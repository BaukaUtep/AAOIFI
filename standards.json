When the Institution deposits to the credit of a customer’s account a sum of money directly or through a bank transfer. 2. When the customer enters into a spot contract of currency exchange between himself and the Institution, in the case of the purchase of a currency against another currency already deposited in the account of the customer. 3. When the Institution debits – by the order of the customer – a sum of money to the latter’s account and credits it to another account in a different currency, either in the same Institution or another Institution, for the benefit of the customer or any other payee. In following such a procedure, the Institution shall adhere to the principles of Islamic law regarding currency exchange. A delay in making the transfer is allowed to the Institution, consistent with the practice whereby a payee may obtain actual receipt according to prevailing business practices in currency markets. However, the payee is not entitled to dispose of the currency during the transfer period, unless and until the effect of the bank transfer has taken effect so that the payee is able to make an actual delivery of the currency to a third party. b) Receipt of a cheque constitutes constructive possession, provid ed the balance payable is available in the account of the issuer in the currency of the cheque and the Institution has blocked such a balance for payment. c) The receipt of a voucher by a merchant, signed by the credit card holder (buyer), is constructive possession of the amount of currency entered as payable on the coupon provided that the card issuing Institution pays the amount without deferment to the merchant accepting the card.",

The best known Hadith is the one reported on the authority of Ubadah Ibn Al-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver – until he said - equal for equal, like for like, hand to hand, if the kinds of assets differ, you may sell them as you wish provided it is hand to hand.”(2) The other Hadith, reported on the authority of Abu Sa’id Al-Khudri, is that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Do not sell gold for gold except equal for equal and do not sell what is deferred for a spot exchange.”(3) These two Hadiths show clearly enough that gold is of one kind and the silver is of another. A few decisions have been issued by Islamic Fiqh organizations(4) in accordance with the Shari’ah ruling that has been already accepted amongst the jurists, namely that dinars are of a different kind from dirhams. Contemporary Islamic Fiqh scholars have made an analogy between paper and coin money and gold and silver money referred to in the prophetic Hadith. The currency of each country is considered as being of a kind that is different from that of other countries as they are ‘constructive money’ according to the decision of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy.(5) Therefore, these currencies differ in kind according to the authority that considers them as money. On this basis, it has been a condition, in the exchange of currencies that are of the same kind, that equality in amount as well as taking possession of the two countervalues before the two contracting parties depart the place of the closing of the contract. However, if the kind of the currencies to be exchanged is different, then it is permissible for the amounts to be different, but the condition of taking possession of the countervalues before the two contracting parties leave the place of signature of the contract shall prevail. Shari’ah Ruling on Trading in Currencies The original ruling on trading in currencies is that it is permissible, as it falls under the general Islamic provisions regarding the permissibility of it falls under the general Islamic provisions regarding the permissibility of selling gold, silver and money because this is one means of earning a profit. This ruling is applicable as long as there is no reason for considering the dealing as prohibited or objectionable. The basis of this ruling is the Hadith that are available with regard to exchange of currencies and the general ruling that is derived from these Hadith as decided by the jurists in the chapter on currency exchange. Whenever one of the Shari’ah precepts is not met, then the dealing is not permissible. Stipulation of Equality and Taking Possession While equality of the countervalues and concurrent taking of possession are required in the exchange of two similar kinds of currencies, only bilateral taking of possession is required in the exchange of two dissimilar kinds, based on the basis stated in (1) above. Constructive Possession Constructive possession –as in the forms mentioned in the standard– is on an equal footing with actual possession, because the Shari’ah never prescribed a particular method for taking possession. Therefore, reference must be made to the prevailing custom in the business community which results in the ability to dispose of the currency for the intended purpose and transfer of the risk of the currency to the transferee, as in the forms mentioned in the standard. As for the various forms of constructive possession, there is a decision issued by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy,(6) and the various Fatwa Committees have added to these forms some others, such as the credit card settlement coupon.(7) The Ninth Seminar of Al Baraka(8) has confirmed the prohibition of giving a guarantee by one of the parties in Mudarabah or Musharakah transactions to the other party, to indemnify him against currency risks. Agency in Exchange of Currencies and Issue of Taking Possession Agency in exchange of currencies is permissible because agency is permissible with regard to an activity that the principal could undertake personally. As one could undertake the exchange himself, then it is also permissible for him to authorise its undertaking by others on his behalf. However, since taking possession of the countervalues immediately after concluding the contract has been a juristic condition, the juristic requirement in the case of agency would be the taking possession by the parties to the contract of exchange, whether through principal or agent. When the agency is for the purpose of taking possession only, the juristic rule relates to the leaving of the place of execution of the contract by both principals before possession is taken, and not to the agent’s doing so. Use of Modern Means of Communication for Trading in Currencies The International Islamic Fiqh Academy(9) issued a decision on the sub ject of those means of communication. This is a reinforcement of what has already been approved by the jurists on the permissibility of concluding a contract via writing and communications that can be understood. This would cover all contemporary means such as telex, fax, internet, etc. Bilateral Promise in Exchange of Currencies The prohibition of a binding bilateral promise in an exchange of currencies is supported by the majority of Shari’ah jurists, because binding bilateral promises from two parties are equivalent to a contract, and also for the reason that the bilateral promise is not immediately followed by taking possession of the countervalues, since it is not the wish of the parties to take possession at that time. Financial Institutions have a customary practice of treating promises as binding, even when formally they are not. A promise from one party only (as opposed to a bilateral promise) is permissible in currency exchange, even if it is binding. Exchange of Currencies that Are Owed by the Parties The basis of the permissibility of an exchange of amounts denominated The basis of the permissibility of an exchange of amounts denominated in currencies that are debts established as an obligation of the debtor, on the condition that the two obligations are thereby settled, is that this would entail the settlement of the debt by discharging it. This does not involve any prohibited transaction pertaining to debts either with regard to sale or purchase. As for some of the forms mentioned in the standard, there are texts to support them, inter alia, the Hadith reported on the authority of Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “I have met the Prophet (peace be upon him) at the house of Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with her). And I said to him: ‘O Prophet of Allah, I would like to ask you; ‘I sell a camel in Al-Baqi’ to him: ‘O Prophet of Allah, I would like to ask you; ‘I sell a camel in Al-Baqi’ for a price quoted in dinar but I take dirham, and I sell for a price quoted in dirham but I take dinars, I take this from this and I give this from this’. The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied: ‘There is no objection to your taking the other currency based on the price of the day, provided you do not leave each other with something remaining owed as a debt between you’.”(10) Some of the forms in the standard are a kind of set-off and this is permissible. Combination of Currency Exchange and Transfer of Money The basis of the permissibility of the combination of currency exchange The basis of the permissibility of the combination of currency exchange and transfer of money is the achievement of constructive possession by virtue of a bank draft for the amount that is given in one currency in return for an amount paid in another currency for the purpose of its transfer. In this regard, there is a decision by the International Islamic Academy of Fiqh that reads: “If a transfer of money is to be made in a currency different from the currency of the amount paid by the applicant, then the transaction is based on currency exchange and transfer of money. The currency exchange takes place before the transfer, that is, the customer pays the amount of money to the bank and the bank, after agreeing on the currency exchange rate that is printed on the receipt delivered to the customer, issues a bank draft on the basis of transfer of debt in the sense that has been mentioned.”(11) Forms of Trading in Currencies The following form is not permissible: providing a type of financial facility to a customer who wishes to engage in currency trading which enables him to deal in amounts that he does not own and to sell amounts that he does not own. An alternative and permissible form is that the Institution lends the money to the customer so that the latter would then deal in amounts that he owns. However, this would not be permissible if the Institution made it a condition of the loan that the customer must carry out the currency trading with the Institution, as this would involve a combination of both loan and contract of exchange. This is not permissible because it results in a benefit to the lender. Where no such condition is imposed, there is no prohibition.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard 1. Debit Cards It is permissible to issue debit cards subject to the conditions mentioned in It is permissible to issue debit cards subject to the conditions mentioned in the standard, because such issuance does not incur any Shari’ah prohibition. 2. Charge card It is permissible to issue charge cards subject to the conditions mentioned in the standard, because such issuance does not incur Shari’ah prohibition and because the contract involved does not grant credit facilities to the cardholder in exchange for interest. Prohibition might be caused by conditions incorporated in the contract, or by dealings of the cardholder, which contravene the Shari’ah. 3. Credit card It is prohibited to issue credit cards, as mentioned in the standard, where such issuance is based on a contract granting the cardholder the right to a revolving credit on terms that involve interest, because Riba is prohibited in terms of either taking or giving. The prohibition of Riba is established through Quranic Texts, direct and certain Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the consensus of Muslim scholars, rendering its prohibition well known in the Muslim community as self-evident. However, the issuance of credit cards free from Riba, or from any other legal prohibition, is permissible. 4. Institution’s affiliation to membership of international card regulatory organizations is permissible because the contracts of the Institutions with those organizations are free from Shari’ah infringements. The fees that the companies pay are the charges for the services rendered by the international organizations, by granting a license, carrying out set-off in transactions and other services. The transactions do not relate to the advance of loans interest, since the dealings of the Institutions are confined to debit and charge cards that are free from any requirement to pay interest. These dealings do not involve credit cards of the type that are not permissible for the reason given above. 5. It is permissible for Institutions to charge the party accepting a card commission based on the prices of purchases or services made with the card, as this can be considered as partly a brokerage and marketing fee as well as a service charge for the collection of the debt. 6. It is permissible for Institutions to charge the cardholder membership or renewal or replacement fees, because these fees are in exchange for the right given to the customer to carry the card and to benefit from its services. 7. Purchasing with a debit card constitutes constructive possession as endorsed by the Shari’ah. When the purchaser receives gold or silver or currencies which he is buying, uses the card and signs the payment coupon for the account of the party accepting the card, then constructive possession takes place. This ruling is extracted from the decision of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy(2) which states that an accounting entry is considered to be constructive possession. Thus, the legal condition of taking possession is satisfied when using cards to purchase gold or silver or currencies. 8. It is permissible for the cardholder to withdraw cash from his available funds at the bank using the card, because this is to withdraw his own money. Likewise, it is permissible for him to withdraw more than his available funds from the Institution, if the latter has agreed that he may do so and has not stipulated that interest is payable on the such amounts. This is a permissible loan. 9. In the case of the Institution stipulating that the cardholder must deposit a sum of money prior to receiving approval to use the card, then it is not permitted for the Institution to prevent the cardholder from investing the amount deposited in his account, as this would be tantamount to a loan that draws extra benefit. For that reason, the appropriate alternative is for amounts so deposited to be invested for the benefit of the cardholder on the basis of profit and loss sharing.",

    "section_title": "Appendix (B)",
    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Default on the Part of a Debtor The debtor must settle his debt when it is due. Default in payment by a debtor who is able to settle the debt is prohibited. The Prophet (peace be upon him) says: “Default in payment on the part of a solvent debtor is unjust.”(2) He (peace be upon him) also says: “Delay in payment by a solvent debtor would be a legal ground for his being publicly dishonoured and punished.”(3) Moreover, he (peace be upon him) approved the statement of Salman Al-Farisi to Abu Al-Darda` saying: “Give everyone his right.”(4) Muslim scholars have agreed on the permissibility of a debtor being punished in such circumstances.(5) However, an insolvent debtor should be granted a grace period. Stipulation of, or Legal Claim for, Compensation for Late Payment of the Debt It is not permitted to stipulate as a condition of a contract involving indebtedness that in case of default the debtor should pay compensation, or to have a legal claim for compensation against a defaulting debtor, whether such arrangements are made at the beginning of the contract or on its maturity, since this would constitute Riba and any such stipulation or arrangement is null and void. This is because the Prophet (peace be upon him) says: “Muslims are bound by their contractual conditions, except those that render impermissible what is permissible or render permissible what is impermissible.”(6) There is also the reason that, during the pre Islamic period, lenders who charged interest used to say to their debtors: “Do you want to settle now or to pay an additional amount for a further period of credit?”. The prohibition of any loan which requires a payment in excess of the amount lent has also been reported on the authority of many companions from the Prophet (peace be upon him). On this basis, a decision was reached by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy which reads as follows: “It is impermissible from the Shari’ah perspective to stipulate a condition of compensation in the case of delay in the settlement of a debt”.(7) No penalty clause may be applied in the case of a delay in settling a debt, as any increase in the amount of the debt is Riba; this is in contrast to the application of a penalty clause to other cases of delay, such as delay in fulfilling construction or Istisna’a contracts. As the judgement on this issue by the court is binding, it is therefore not permitted to stipulate such a condition directly in the contract creating a debt or to enforce it subsequently by recourse to the judiciary. Litigation Expenses A defaulting debtor must bear the litigation expenses and other expenses relating to his default in payment as he is the cause of the expenses.(8) Disposal of a Mortgaged Asset It is permissible for the creditor to demand the selling of a mortgaged asset and other properties belonging to a debtor which are in his possession for the purpose of liquidation and recovery of the debt. Furthermore, it is permissible for the creditor to obtain a mandate from the debtor to sell the mortgaged assets or other properties of the debtor, because such disposal is permissible for the creditor, and such a practice would speed up the procedures for disposing of the charged asset.(9) Maturity of Instalments in the Case of Instalment Credit It is permissible for the creditor to impose the condition that, if the debtor is late in paying one instalment, all the instalments become due. To this effect, there is a decision by the International Islamic Academy of Fiqh, the text of which reads as follows: “It is permissible for a seller on deferred credit terms sale to impose the condition that instalments become due before their original due date in case of the delay of the debtor in paying some of the instalments, so long as the debtor consented to this condition when the contract was agreed”.(10) Such a condition would be valid, as there is no Shari’ah text to the contrary, and it serves a lawful interest of the creditor.(11) Giving prior notice to the debtor before giving effect to such a condition is merely of the nature of a reminder, so as to provide him with reasonable time for payment. The Right to Repossess a Sold Asset If an asset sold by Murabahah or another sales contract is still available to the seller, and the purchaser has defaulted in the payment of the price, and subsequently has become bankrupt, then the seller is entitled to repossess the sold asset instead of initiating legal proceedings to obtain a bankruptcy order. This judgement is based on the report of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (prayers and peace of Allah be upon him) said: If one party has sold an asset and the other party (the purchaser) has become bankrupt, and the former party has managed to retain the asset, then he is more qualified to take possession of the asset in preference to the other creditors.(12) A Commitment on the Part of the Debtor to Make a Donation in Case of Default The permissibility of stipulating a condition, whereby the debtor in case of default is obliged to donate a sum of money (in addition to the amount of the debt) to be spent by the creditor (the Institution) on charitable causes, is because this has been considered as an instance of the commitment to make a donation, which is well established in the Maliki school of law. This is the opinion of Abu Abdullah Ibn Nafi’ and Muhammad Ibn Ibrahim Ibn Dinar, two Maliki jurists.(13) Guarantor A guarantor is liable for anything for which the debtor whose debt is guaranteed is liable, because standing as a surety adds one obligation to another with respect to the liability. This is in line with the Quranic verse expressing the statement of Prophet Yusuf (peace be upon him) saying: {“... and I will be a guarantor to it”}.(14) Also, the Prophet (peace be upon him) affirmed the suretyship of Abu Qatadah in respect of the debt of a deceased person, when Abu Qatadah said; “I take responsibility as surety for both (two dinars), O Messenger of Allah.”(15) It is a principle of law that the demand for payment from either the debtor or guarantor is permissible, as this is the very essence of suretyship, so long as there is no stipulation that the demand be in sequence; that is, it must start with the debtor and once he refuses to pay, payment will be demanded from the guarantor, because this sequence is a valid stipulation and believers are bound by their stipulations. Contractor or Concessionaire It is permissible to impose penalty clauses in contracts for constructions, Istisna’a and supply contracts, as such clauses are included in what may be validly stipulated as part of the contract. This does not render the impermissible permissible, or vice versa, and it complies with the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Muslims are bound by contractual conditions, except those that render impermissible what is permissible or render permissible what is impermissible.”(16) Also, this is based on the statement of Shurayh (may Allah confer mercy upon him) saying: “Whoever has bound himself by a contractual condition voluntarily without any coercion, is bound by that condition”. The International Islamic Fiqh Academy has also issued a decision which states: “It is permissible to include in an Istisna’a contract a penalty clause according to what is agreed upon by the two contracting parties provided that there are no unusual circumstances.(17) In addition, it is a juristic principle in the Hanbali school of law. This is also what has been decided by consensus of the Council of the Eminent Scholars of Saudi Arabia, in the following words: “The council has decided by consensus that a penalty clause that is stipulated in a contract has decided by consensus that a penalty clause that is stipulated in a contract is a valid and enforceable stipulation”.(18) It is well known that the stipulation of the penalty clause is permissible only for non-financial obligations. Non-Material Penalties Applied to the Debtor in Case of Default The grounds for such penalties lie in the jurists’ decision which is based on their interpretation of the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Delay in payment by a solvent debtor would be a legal ground for his being publicly criticised and punished”.(19) A public complaint about his default in payment is not a prohibited slander; on the contrary, there is an obligation to warn other companies about his character, as this falls under the category of advice which it is a duty to give. General Provisions a) The monitoring of the affairs of the default debtor, is a kind of pursuing that has been established by the Shari’ah jurists. This pursuit is intended to make recovery from the defaulting debtor out of assets that he may have concealed from the knowledge of the creditor. In the circumstances, such pursuit does not constitute interference in the affairs of others. b) The debtor may, entirely at his own discretion without any condition or customary practice, pay an additional amount when settling the debt, and this is part of good settlement following the saying of Allah: {“...No ground (of complaint) can there be against the Muhsinun (good-doers)...”}.(20) Also, the prophetic Hadith says: “Verily the best of you is he who is the best in the settlement of debt.”(21) The Prophet (peace be upon him), occasionally used to pay an additional amount when settling a debt. The permissibility of this practice depends on the discretionary nature of this extra payment and the absence of any stipulation or customary practice of making such a payment, since the existence of such a customary practice would be inconsistent with the condition that the extra payment be entirely discretionary and not stipulated. c) It is permissible to accept the extra amount paid by the debtor following the proofs mentioned earlier. ( d) A stipulation by an Institution that it may recover amounts owing to it by a defaulting debtor by right of set-off from accounts of the debtor that are kept by the Institution is valid, since believers are bound by their stipulations. This right of set-off, even though it does not require the consent of the debtor, should preferably be documented in the contract that establishes the indebtedness, in order to shorten the procedures in case of dispute. This right is based on the amicable right of recovery that is based on Shari’ah evidence including the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him) to the wife of Abu Sufyan: “Take (from his property) what would suffice you and your child amicably.",

In addition, there is no Shari’ah objection to a set-off taking place on demand. The authority for this permissibility is that the person entitled to the superior debt has agreed to forgo the advantage attached to his debt and the Shari’ah will not object to such a gesture. If set-off is executed contractually, it is then based on the prophetic Hadith stating; “Muslims are bound by the conditions and agreements they have made, except a condition that has rendered the unlawful lawful or rendered the lawful unlawful.",

A debt is any liability that is not in terms of a specified or defined item, whatever the cause of its establishment, i.e. whether its origin is in cash or in a commodity, or in a particular described benefit such as the benefit of using particular things or services of persons. For instance, the consideration in deferred sales and loans is described as a debt. The relationship between a loan and a debt is that the latter is more general than the former, since every loan is described as a debt but the converse is not true. Not all debts originate from a loan. In this sense, a loan is but one cause of the creation of debt. Due Debt. A due debt is a debt that is immediately payable or that is payable on the creditor’s demand, whether on its original due date or, if it has been rescheduled and deferred, on its rescheduled due date. Deferred Debt. A deferred debt is a debt the payment thereof is due at a certain time in the future, and it may also be due in periodic instalments over time. Description. A description is a condition that distinguishes particular specimens of the same species from one other. For examples, conditions such as good quality and poor quality, or mortgage of security or personal guarantees, letters of guarantee and the freezing of the amount of cheques for payment which are attached to the debt are considered descriptions. Ibra` (discharge). An act by a person to discharge another person from a liability (owed by the latter to the former) Reconciliation (Sulh). An agreement to solve dispute between parties.

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Permissibility of Guarantees and Its Relevance to Contracts The basis of the permissibility of stipulating guarantees in contracts is that it protects property, which is one of the objectives of Shari’ah. The other authorities mentioned in the standard in support of each kind of guarantee can be cited as authority for the permissibility of guarantees in contracts. Guarantees in Trust Contracts Assets held on trust must be returned to their owners in the manner in which they were received and in their original physical state promptly after the owners demand their return. Allah, the Almighty, says: {“Allah doth command you to render back your trusts to those to whom they are doth command you to render back your trusts to those to whom they are due”}.(2) Since such assets are not subject to exchange, they are purposely meant either for custody with permission to use them, such as assets on deposit, or for charitable acts, such as a loan of tangible assets. Therefore, the persons holding such assets are considered by the owners from the beginning as capable of returning them to their owners on demand, making them trustees, and as a principle of Shari’ah, a trustee is not held liable (for loss of, or damage to, an asset held on trust), except in circumstances of loss of, or damage to, an asset held on trust), except in circumstances of misconduct, negligence or violation of the conditions agreed upon, because in other circumstances it is inconsistent with the fundamental principle of trusts for a trustee to be held liable. Written Documentation and Attestation Written documentation is recommended by Shari’ah. This is the opinion of the majority of Fuqaha, in contrast to Ibn Hazm who argued that written documentation is an obligation (i.e. if one did not put his financial transactions in writing he has committed a sin) relying on the literal meaning of the Qura`nic verse: {“O ye who believe! When you deal with each other, in transactions involving future obligations in a fixed period time, reduce them to writing”}(3) and the Quranic Verse: {“Disdain not to reduce to writing your contract for a future period, whether it be small or big”.(4) The majority of Fuqaha have also inferred that this verse itself excluded written documentation in the cases of trustworthiness, as the last part of the following verse says: {“And if one of you deposits a thing on trust with another, let the trustee (faithfully) discharge his trust and left him fear Allah his Lord.”} It must be noted that customary practice is the basis in determining the form and evidential value of written documentation, because Shari’ah did not specify a particular manner of writing to be considered. As for the permissibility of attestation as documentation, the authority for that is the following Qura`nic verse: {“And get out two witnesses, out of your own men. And if there are not two men, then a man and two women, such as ye choose, for witnesses, so that if one of them errs, the other can remind her”}.(5) The evidential value of attestation according to traditional Fuqaha is stronger than that of written documentation. But in modern times, things have changed so that some laws rely on witnesses only in a very limited number of cases and paramount importance is given to written documentary evidence. Personal Guarantees Permissibility of personal guarantees Personal guarantees derive their permissibility from the Qura`n, Sunnah, consensus and reasoning. In the Qura`n, Allah, the Almighty, says: {“They said: ‘We miss the great beaker of the king; for him who produces it, is (the reward of) a camel load; I will be bound by it’”}.(6) In Sunnah, there is the Hadith narrated by Salamah Ibn Al-Akwa’, who said: “We were with the Prophet (peace be upon him) when a deceased person was brought. They said, ‘O Prophet of Allah, perform prayers on him.’ He (peace be upon him) said, ‘Has the deceased left anything?’ They said, ‘No.’ He (peace be upon him) said, ‘Is he in debt?’ They said, ‘Three dinars.’ He said, ‘Perform prayers on your companion.’ Abu Qatadah said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, perform prayer on him, and I am responsible for his debt.’ Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) performed prayers on him.”(7) In another text of the Hadith, he (Qatadah) said: “I guarantee (to pay) his debt.”(8) The Fuqaha are unanimous on the permissibility of personal guarantees. Moreover, the need of people for personal guarantees to facilitate dealings with each other had also made them legitimate, particularly in the case of with each other had also made them legitimate, particularly in the case of customers who lack a good credit record. In addition, personal guarantees encourage performance and prevent the contract from being breached and this security also justifies their permissibility. The objection to taking consideration for personal guarantees is that giving a guarantee is one of the charitable acts that should be offered without consideration, and this ruling has generated consensus among the Fuqaha. Moreover, a personal guarantee indicates a readiness to give away the amount of a loan, which means that the guarantor will pay the loan (if the principal debtor fails to pay) and have recourse to the guaranteed person for fulfilment. Hence, it is not permissible to take consideration for a guarantee, because it is not permissible to take consideration for giving away the amount of the loan itself, since such consideration is considered to be Riba. Guaranteeing unknown and future debts The Shari’ah basis for the permissibility of guaranteeing the unknown The Shari’ah basis for the permissibility of guaranteeing the unknown is the general meaning of the Hadith: “The guarantor is liable.”(9) because this Hadith makes no distinction between guaranteeing the known and the unknown since there is no harm or element of dispute arising due to uncertainty here, because the unknown transaction guaranteed will become certain and known, and the guarantor will know, after the debt is incurred, the actual obligation he undertakes. Another authority for the permissibility of guaranteeing what is not known is the Quranic verse: {“...for him who produces it, is (the reward of) a camel load and I will be bound by it”.(10) Here, the guarantor guaranteed a camel load although it was not yet a debt. The evidence for the creditor’s right to demand payment from either the debtor or the guarantor is that the debt is established as liability of both of them, hence the right to demand payment from either of them. The permissibility for stipulating that the creditor has first to ask for payment from the principal debtor and that he may ask the guarantor for payment only if the debtor fails to pay, is based on an opinion in the Maliki school of law(11) and it is also an opinion of the Hanafis.(12) These opinions argued that if the debtor is solvent then demanding payment from the guarantor is pointless, unless the debtor refuses to pay. So, the requirement that payment pointless, unless the debtor refuses to pay. So, the requirement that payment be first sought from the debtor has a Shari’ah basis as well as being a case of adherence to a principle of natural justice. Bringing Forward Future Instalments in Case of Default in Payment The basis for this condition is the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Muslims are bound by the conditions they made,”(13) and because payment on a deferred basis is the right of the debtor, and the debtor may choose to pay before time and relinquish the deferral of the date of payment entirely. If this is the case, the date of payment may also be based on default so as to strengthen the collectibility of the debt and secure payment on time. The basis of the rule enabling the creditor to demand payment of all time. The basis of the rule enabling the creditor to demand payment of all instalments in the event of default, instead of waiting until each instalment is due, is the possibility that during the period of delay in payment the debtor may find a means to conceal his assets and claim insolvency. The permissibility of this condition is confirmed by the Resolution No. (51) issued by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy. Termination of a Sale on Deferred Payment Terms in Case of Failure to Pa The basis for this is that the seller has consented to deferred payment only if it will not lead to a loss of what is due to him. This is the opinion of the majority of Fuqaha, as opposed to the Hanafis who have confined the creditor’s right to litigation, unless he has stipulated the right to terminate the contract and “Muslims are bound by conditions they made.” Guarantees and Their Modern Applications Letters of Guarantee The basis of the rule that no remuneration may be taken for a guarantee per se is that it is a surety, and as such it is one of the contracts of charity since it involves a readiness to give away the amount of a loan for no consideration. The majority of Fuqaha agree that it is prohibited to take consideration for guarantee. However, issuing the letter of guarantee is a service that justifies charging fees. The prohibition of issuing a letter of guarantee for unlawful acts is analogous to the prohibition of giving assistance in committing a sin. The Hadith: “Allah curses the one who gives Riba and the one who takes it and the one who writes its contract and the two witnesses involved”(14) also supports this ruling, because the personal guarantor has a stronger role in establishing and recovering a debt than the writer of the contract and the witness mentioned in the Hadith. Documentary credits The basis for the permissibility of charging fees for a documentary credit is that issuing a documentary credit is a service performed in the interest of the applicant for the documentary credit, for which the Bank has the right to charge fees. Use of cheques or promissory notes The Shari’ah basis for obtaining cheques or promissory notes from the debtor as a guarantee is the general sources on the permissibility of guar antees in general. Insurance for debts Islamic insurance is based on the principle of donation, and Gharar is tolerable in such conditions. In Islamic insurance, the instalments that are paid are provided within a framework of donations organised for the mutual benefit of the contributors to the insurance fund. The permissibility of Islamic insurance is confirmed by the resolutions issued by the Islamic Fiqh Academy of the World Muslim League (15) and the International Islamic Fiqh Academy of the Organisation of Islamic Conference.(16) Although this form of insurance falls within the meaning of a guarantee, the guarantee here is not provided in return for conditional consideration as such, hence the permissibility of subscribing to an Islamic insurance coverage as the permissibility of subscribing to an Islamic insurance coverage as security for doubtful or bad debts. Freezing cash deposits The basis for the permissibility of stipulating a right to freeze acustomer’s The basis for the permissibility of stipulating a right to freeze acustomer’s investment account is the permissibility of pledging funds, in addition to the fact that the purpose behind such freezing is to be able to agree on a set-off if it appears that the pledgor of the balance is in debt to the bank. It is a form of mortgage to secure a possible future debt. The basis for the prohibition of stipulating a right to freeze a customer’s current account is that such a right would be tantamount to a combination of a sale on deferred payment terms and a loan transaction; i.e., it amounts to a deferred sale with a condition to provide a loan, which is prohibited by Shari’ah. Third party guarantees The basis for third party guarantees is that they are a promise to volunteer to remedy a loss of capital under an investment contract with a party other than the volunteer. This is a permissible act as a volunteer, as is evidenced in the Holy Qura`n: {“No ground (of complaint) can there be against such as do right,”}.(17) A resolution passed by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy states as follows: “There is no Shari’ah objection to mention in the prospectus of the issue or in the documents of Muqaradah (Mudarabah) bonds the promise of a third party, who is independent personally and in terms of financial liability from the two parties to the contract, to volunteer an amount of money for no consideration to be allocated to make good a loss on a particular project. However, this is circumscribed with a condition that such a promise should be an obligation independent from the Mudarabah contract. In other words, the third party’s performance of his obligation should not be a condition for the enforcement of the contract and the conditions and liabilities of the parties to the contract. As such, holders of the bonds or the manager of the Mudarabah are not entitled to claim that they may fail to honour their obligations relating to their contracts because the volunteer failed to fulfil his promise because the performance of their obligations takes into consideration the promise to volunteer.”(18) Underwriting the subscription of shares issued If such underwriting is offered without consideration, it is considered as a personal guarantee for no consideration, and this is permissible in Shari’ah. However, if it is for consideration, the basis for its prohibition is what we have mentioned in respect to taking a commission for a guarantee. [see item 4/1] Guarantees in tenders, security deposits in Murabahah transactions and ’Arboun (Earnest Money) The basis for the permissibility of guarantees in tenders and earnest The basis for the permissibility of guarantees in tenders and earnest money is the afore-mentioned authority for guarantees in general. Both guarantees in tenders and security deposits are permissible because they facilitate obtaining compensation for actual damages in case of breach of contract. The basis for obtaining the earnest money to secure performance is the practice of Umar Ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) in the presence of some companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him), which has been permitted by Imam Ahmad. A resolution has been issued in connection with the permissibility of ’Arboun (Earnest Money) by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy.(19) Priority right of recovery and the right to follow up The basis for the permissibility of the priority of certain rights, such as those of liquidators, is that these rights are considerations that are determined by the judiciary on the basis of public interest. The basis for giving priority by the judiciary on the basis of public interest. The basis for giving priority to a person whose assets per se have contributed to the increase of the bankrupt’s assets, and have been located and identified, is the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “If one sells a commodity, and the owner thereof becomes bankrupt, and then he finds it without being altered, he has more right over it than the other creditors.”(20) A resolution in connection with the permissibility of preference was issued by the Second Fiqh Seminar hosted by Kuwait Finance House, based on a number of Fiqh rulings determining certain preferences that include priority in the recovery of debts. The right of following up the subject of a mortgage is based on the fact that the aim of the mortgage is to facilitate recovery of the amount of the debt and leaving the debtor without a right of follow-up will defeat this objective.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Gradual Clearance of Non-Permissible Previous Transactions The basis for the permissibility of gradual clearance of non-permissible previous transactions due to necessity or need and in accordance with the rules of Shari’ah is because it is not feasible for the converting bank to clear all non-permissible transactions immediately. Therefore, the bank must dispose of the effects of impermissible transactions because this is feasible. Necessary Procedures and Mechanisms for Conversion Since the realisation of the conversion is dependent on the procedures and mechanisms mentioned in this standard, these procedures and mechanisms thus become permissible or in certain circumstances their use becomes obligatory when the conversion will not be realised without applying these procedures and mechanisms. This is because conversion is obligatory, and if an obligation can be realised only by means of a particular way or tool, then the use of such a tool also becomes an obligation. Providing Banking Services The basis for the permissibility of providing banking services that are not related to giving loans on an interest-bearing basis is that such an operation is a practical application of Ijarah and an agency contract with remuneration. If providing these services involves Riba then the operation becomes impermissible as it is a Riba-based transaction that is prohibited by Shari’ah. Attracting Investments The conversion necessitates doing away with the conventional methods of attracting investment funds such as interest-bearing deposits, which should be replaced by the application of Mudarabah and Musharakah contracts or acting as an investment agent. The basis for the impermissibility of using conventional methods of attracting investments is the Saying of Allah, the Exalted: {“But Allah has permitted trade and forbidden usury”}.(2) The basis for terminating all previous impermissible transactions is the The basis for terminating all previous impermissible transactions is the Saying of Allah, the Exalted: {“Give up what remains of your demand for usury”}.(3) Also, a number of Shari’ah boards have issued resolutions for the treatment of pre-conversion liabilities that involve payment of interest by using Shari’ah acceptable instruments and the conversion of interest-based bonds to Islamic certificates and shares.(4) The Fiqh Academy under the auspices of the Muslim World League has issued a resolution confirming the permissibility of Tawarruq (which is one of the instruments that can be used to acquire liquidity).(5) Investment of Funds ■ The basis for the rule that the bank must cease investing through making loans and receiving interest is that this is Riba and paying or receiving Riba is prohibited. ■ The basis for the alternatives to interest-based transactions provided in this standard is the authorities that are mentioned for each investment instrument in details in the Fiqh books(6) and the Shari’ah Standards. Treatment of Impermissible Rights of the Bank before the Decision to Convert ■ The basis for not obliging the bank to dispose of impermissible in tangible assets from the previous financial period, i.e. before the year of conversion, is because the management of the bank cannot change rights originating in the previous financial period, as the responsibili ty and authority for doing so ends at the end of the previous financial period. As for the shareholders (the owners), they are obliged personally to dispose of any dividends from non-permissible earnings that were distributed to them, because the responsibility of shareholders remains even after termination of the responsibility of the manage ment at the end of the financial period, i.e. the end of financial period does exonerate shareholders from responsibility. ■ The basis for allowing the bank to keep impermissible earnings and in The basis for allowing the bank to keep impermissible earnings and in come of doubtful permissibility earned on the basis of an interpretation of a person who is qualified to perform Ijtihad on issues that are subject to personal juristic interpretation and the juristic position of an authorita tive School of Shari’ah, etc., is that the Shari’ah validates actions that occur on the basis of an interpretation that one believes to be valid until such an interpretation is proved incorrect. The scholars are unanimous that in times of social unrest due to the actions of insurgents who believe in their cause by interpretation or Ijtihad to the effect that they have a right to do so, the insurgents are entitled to items of property they acquire during this time, even if they realise later that they were wrong and end their act of insurgence.(7) ■ The basis for destroying the bank’s non-permissible tangible assets The basis for destroying the bank’s non-permissible tangible assets in the possession of others before the year of conversion is that these assets are worthless by Shari’ah Standards since they are impermissible. assets are worthless by Shari’ah Standards since they are impermissible. This is because disposing of a prohibited thing is an obligation as in the case when the verse that prohibited liquor was revealed people discharged the wine that was in their possession. Treatment of Non-Permissible Liabilities of the Bank before the Decision to Convert ■ The basis for the rule that the bank should refrain from paying inter est after the conversion is because such interest is not, by the Shari’ah Standard, a valid debt that should be honoured. Again, repentance through conversion necessitates refraining from prohibited acts in cluding payment of interest. The principle of necessity is the basis for cluding payment of interest. The principle of necessity is the basis for allowing payment of interest if the bank could not refrain from doing so because of lack of legal protection and the possibility that the bank may be subject to punishment that may prevent the avoidance of pay ing interest. The payment of interest due to necessity is supported by saying of Allah, the Exalted: {“Whoever disbelieved in Allah after his belief, except him who is forced thereto and whose heart is at rest with Faith...”}(8) and the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Verily, Allah, the Exalted, Has forgiven my ummah those act done by mistake, forgetfulness and compulsion”.(9) ■ The basis for making a distinction between the principal loan and in The basis for making a distinction between the principal loan and in terest is because the loan contracts per se are valid. It is the interest associated with the loan that is forbidden. This is the view of the Hanafi jurists who say that the loan contract itself is valid and the condition to pay interest is void.(10) Again, the basis for this ruling is the legal maxim that says acts of Muslims must be deemed valid as far as possible even if their acts are based on a non-preferable juristic view.(11) ■ The basis for the requirement that the outside buyer interested in converting the conventional bank should exert all possible effort to exclude impermissible rights is that the payment of interest is the responsibility of the seller. Such interest would have no bearing on the buyer of the bank as the seller’s right to receive such interest can be taken into account in computing the price to be paid for the bank. If the buyer is unable to convince the seller in this respect, the principle of necessity becomes applicable with regard to payment of interest. The basis for extinguishing Riba-based loans as soon as possible even The basis for extinguishing Riba-based loans as soon as possible even if such an act will impose on the buyer the need to suggest to the creditor/s early payment of these loans for a discount is the principle of Da’ Wa Ta’jjal (discount for acceleration of payment) that was endorsed by the resolution of International Islamic Fiqh Academy provided the discount was not agreed upon earlier.(12) ■ The basis for requiring that the purchaser accelerate the redemption of all impermissible mortgages attached to the assets of the bank is because Riba is prohibited; hence, securing payment of Riba by personal guar Riba is prohibited; hence, securing payment of Riba by personal guar antees or mortgages is also prohibited. It must be noted that the grave ness of securing Riba by personal guarantee is greater than graveness of ness of securing Riba by personal guarantee is greater than graveness of securing Riba by writing and attestation, which were mentioned in the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Allah curses the one who take (earn) Riba, the one who gives it, the one who scribe it and the two witnesses”.(13) Treatment of Impermissible Tangible Assets Acquired by the Bank Before the Decision to Convert ■ The basis for destroying the existing tangible assets of the bank after conversion has already been explained. The basis for donating to char ity receivables earned from trading in such assets has also been ex plained earlier. The basis for transforming the locations that were used for impermissible services to locations for permissible services is that the prohibition does not concern the location itself, rather the prohibi tion relates to the use of the location. Disposal of Impermissible Rights ■ The basis for the requirement that impermissible earnings be donated to charity is that these revenues are not permissible for the person who earns them. This is evidenced by the order of the Prophet (peace be upon him) that the usurped goat be given to war prisoners.(14) ■ The basis for indicating charity as a way of disposing of impermissi ble earnings is that by transferring the ownership of these earnings, the characterisation of prohibition in respect to these earnings is changed and they become permissible for the beneficiary. Again, a thing which is prohibited for one person is not necessarily prohibited for another person, i.e. when it is prohibited for one, it may be permissible for other. The International Islamic Fiqh Academy has issued a resolution in sup port of this ruling.(15) ■ The basis for allowing delay in disposal of non-permissible earnings if such disposal will lead a total breakdown of the activities of the bank or its bankruptcy is that the Fuqaha were of the view that a repentant may use impermissible earnings to cover his unavoidable needs. However, the use impermissible earnings to cover his unavoidable needs. However, the Institution is not entitled to benefit whatsoever, i.e. directly or indirectly, from the earnings that must be disposed of. This is because such benefit adds value to the asset of the Institution. ■ The channels for disposing of impermissible earnings include, as well as those mentioned in this standard, all other channels of disposal that the Shari’ah Supervisory Board of each Institution will regard as appropriate channels for disposal of impermissible earnings.",

The fee that the Institution gains from this transaction is consideration for the delivery of the money and it is not an additional amount gained by the Institution over the amount transferred. However, if a remittance is to take place in a currency different from that presented by the applicant for the transfer, then the transaction consists of a combination of currency exchange and a transfer of money that is permissible. [see item 2/11 of the Shari’ah Standard on Trading in Currencies] Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Permissibility of Hawalah The contract of Hawalah derives its permissibility from the Qur`an, the Sunnah, Ijma’ (consensus of Fuqaha) and reasoning. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Default on payment by a solvent debtor is unjust, and if anyone of you is transferred to a solvent person, he must accept the transfer.”(2) In another text of the Hadith, related by Ahmad and Al-Bayhaqi, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “If one is referred to a solvent person for the recovery of his right, such a person must accept the transfer”. The Prophet’s order that the creditor must accept the transfer means transfer of debt is legal, otherwise he would not give that order. The permissibility of Hawalah has enjoyed unanimity in Muslim soci eties and communities from time immemorial and there is no report that anyone has disapproved of it.(3) The acceptance of a Hawalah contract is recommended for the transferee if the potential payer is known to be solvent and keeps his promises in respect to payments because it benefits the creditor and gives relief to the debtor from liability by the transfer. The basis that a Hawalah transaction is also Mubah (permissible) for the transferee if the financial status and creditworthiness of the potential payer are unknown is that the order in the above-mentioned Hadith does not make it a condition that the payer be solvent for the permissibility of Hawalah. If the payer is not solvent then the acceptance of the Hawalah by the transferee remains permissible. A Hawalah Contract is Binding If all its conditions are met, a Hawalah contract becomes binding without any difference of opinion among the scholars. Form of a Hawalah Contract The contract of Hawalah cannot be concluded on a deferred basis or subject to the happening of a particular event, as it has the character of a contract of (immediate) exchange. This is because by virtue of the Hawalah contract both the transferee (the payee) and the payer have immediately entered into a new contractual relationship. Also, a Hawalah cannot be concluded on a temporary basis nor can it be contingent on future events, because this conflicts with the nature of Hawalah which is the immediate transfer of the debt to the payer.(4) Types and Rulings of a Hawalah Contract ■ The scholars have unanimously endorsed the permissibility of restricted Hawalah, whether it is restricted to a debt owed to the transferor by the payer or it is restricted to the value of a tangible good belonging to the transferor in the possession of the payer. The unrestricted Hawalah is permitted by the Hanafis only. They based this permissibility on the Prophet’s order that a Hawalah deal must be accepted, without indicating that the payer must be a debtor to the transferor or not. This shows the permissibility of both the unrestricted and restricted Hawalah.(5) ■ The basis for the permissibility of a deferred Hawalah contract is that the payer is liable to make payment to the payee (transferee) by virtue of Hawalah. This permissibility is analogous to the permissibility of a de Hawalah. This permissibility is analogous to the permissibility of a de ferred guarantee contract. As a matter of principle, a right that is due by virtue of Hawalah is similar to a right that is due by virtue of a guarantee contract. Since the latter can be concluded on a deferred basis, so a Hawa lah transaction.(6) ■ The basis for the permissibility of Hawalat al-Haqq (transfer of a right) as advocated by the Hanafis is that its essence is similar to suretyship which is permitted by all four schools of Islamic law, regardless of the name of the contract in this regard.(7) Again, Hawalat al-Haqq does not significantly differ from restricted transfer of debt. If one looks at the change of creditor, then the transaction is one of transfer of rights, and if one looks at the change of debtor, it is a restricted transfer of debt. The differences between transfer of debt and transfer of right are evident in some forms, such as when the creditor makes a gift of the amount of his debt claim against the payer to a person who is not a debtor to the transferor. Here, there are not two debts, hence there is a transfer of right and not a restricted Hawalah because of the lack of two debtors, as the transferor here is not a creditor of the beneficiary from the gift. Conditions of Hawalah ■ The basis for the necessity of the consent of all the three parties in a Hawalah contract is as follows: a) The transferor is required to consent because he might not want a third party to pay the debt on his behalf. Therefore, his consent is necessary party to pay the debt on his behalf. Therefore, his consent is necessary for the permissibility of the Hawalah contract. b) The transferee must also consent to the Hawalah contract because the Hawalah contract necessitates a transfer of his right to payment from the transferor as debtor to another person (the payer), and people differ in various aspects when it comes to payment of debts. c) The payer must also consent in the unrestricted Hawalah because the effect of the Hawalah contract is to make the payer liable for payment and, as a principle; there is no liability without there first being an acceptance of such liability.(8) ■ The basis for the requirement that the transferred debt or the trans ferred part of a debt be equal to the payable debt in kind, type, quality or amount is to avoid Riba. However, this condition does not mean that the liability of the transferor must be similar in quantity to the liability of the payer towards the transferor in order to make a Hawalah con tract valid. In other words, a Hawalah contract is permissible even if the amount of one of the two liabilities is either greater or lesser than the other liability provided that the transferee will be paid only an amount equivalent to his debt. For example, one can transfer the right to his creditor to collect 10 dinars, the equivalent amount of his debt, out of the 20 dinars he is owed. The transferor may also direct the transferee to collect five dinars being his right against the payer out of the ten the transferor owes the transferee. Therefore, the similarity in amount that is required here is that the transferee must not take more than the actual amount of his debt. The intention of this is to avoid Riba.(9) Effect of Hawalah on the Relationship Between the Transferor and the Transferee ■ The reason for saying that the transferor is discharged from liability after the conclusion of a Hawalah transaction is because this is the legal effect of Hawalah. Hawalah means that the other party (the transferee) effect of Hawalah. Hawalah means that the other party (the transferee) is deemed to have received his right to payment by the payer outright, which connotes its obligatory nature. Therefore, the transaction can not be reversed for the simple reason that if something is transferred then it cannot be argued that it remains in the same place. This means the transferee is not entitled to ask the transferor for payment and the payer, on the other hand, becomes liable for payment.(10) ■ The right of the transferee to have recourse, in the event of non-per formance by the payer, to the transferor as advocated by the Hanafis is based on a Hadith. It is reported that Uthman Ibn Affan was asked about a situation in which a transfer of debt is concluded and the transferee found the payer had died in a state of bankruptcy. The answer was that the transferee is entitled to return to the transferor for payment, as the right of a Muslim cannot go unfulfilled.(11) This report reveals that the transferor has a right of recourse to the original debtor if the payment is not attained due to bankruptcy or death of the payer. ■ The Hadith that says, Muslims are bound by the conditions they made(12) is the basis for the view of the majority of jurists that the transferee has a right of recourse to the transferor if he had stipulated that he accepts the transfer on the basis that the payer is solvent and is capable of paying the amount of the debt. Moreover, this stipulation serves the purpose of the contract; hence, termination of the contract takes place if such a condition is not met.(13) The Effect of Hawalah on the Relationship Between the Transferor and the Payer The basis for the rule that the transferor loses his claim over the amount of the debt against the payer after the Hawalah transaction is that the right to this claim has shifted to the transferee by virtue of the contract of Hawalah. The Effect of Hawalah on the Relationship Between the Transferee and the Payer The basis for the rule that the transferee no longer has a financial claim against the transferor is that the contract of Hawalah transfers the liability to pay to the payer.(14) The right of the payer to be entitled to all rights associated with the securities that were available to the debtor (the transferor) is based on the fact that these securities are associated with the debt of the transfer or, which are the subject matter of the Hawalah contract. These rights are therefore transferable with the transfer of the debt liability. Hence, the payer is entitled to all these rights as well. Effect of Death and Bankruptcy on a Hawalah Contract The basis that the death of the transferor will not affect the Hawalah contract is that the transferor, after the Hawalah contract, is not entitled to the transferred debt.(16) In addition, the reason why the death of the payer will not affect the Hawalah contract is that the heirs or the guarantor of the payer, if any, will be liable for payment.(17) The practices of overdrafts, negotiable instruments and endorsing cheques and bills of exchange are valid because they are practical applications of the concept of Hawalah. Transfer of Money (Remittances) The International Islamic Fiqh Academy has issued a resolution in respect to the permissible solutions for the combination of transfer of money (banking remittances) and currency exchange.(18)",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (D) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Preface on the Permissibility of Murabahah Definition of Murabahah Murabahah is selling a commodity as per the purchasing price with a defined and agreed profit mark-up. This mark-up may be a percentage of the selling price or a lump sum. This transaction may be concluded either without a prior promise to buy, in which case it is called an ordinary Mura bahah, or with a prior promise to buy submitted by a person interested in acquiring goods through the Institution, in which case it is called a “banking Murabahah” i.e. Murabahah to the purchase orderer. This transaction is one of the trust-based contracts that depends on transparency as to the actual purchasing price or cost price in addition to common expenses. Permissibility of Murabahah The authorities for the permissibility of Murabahah are authorities on the permissibility of sale. Among them is the saying of Allah, the exalted: {“...Allah has permitted trade...”}.(3) Some scholars has also cited to support the permissibility of Murabahah the saying of Allah, the Exalted: {“It is no crime for you to seek the bounty of your Lord,”} {“It is no crime for you to seek the bounty of your Lord,”}(4) arguing that the bounty mentioned here means profit. The Murabahah is also analogous to a form of sale called Tawliyyah (which means to sell as per the purchasing price without making profit). This is because the Prophet (peace be upon him) purchased a she-camel from Abu Bakr to use it as a transportation to immigrate to Medina. Abu Bakr wanted to give it to the Prophet (peace be upon him) free of charge, but the Prophet refused saying: “I will preferably take it at the acquisition price”. The majority of scholars agreed, in principle, on the permissibility of Murabahah. Promise from the Purchase Orderer ■ The basis for the permissibility of responding to the application of the customer that the Institution buys the commodity from a particular supplier is because such a demand will not affect the acquisition of the commodity by the Institution, especially in view of the fact that this de mand is not binding. The Institution is entitled to acquire the commodity from another supplier provided the commodity complies with the de sired specification. The customer may be forced to fulfil his obligation on the basis of general sources of the Qur`an and Sunnah that require fulfilment of obligation and undertaking. The International Fiqh Acade my has issued a resolution endorsing a unilateral binding promise.(5) The same was adopted in a fatwa for Kuwait Finance House,(6) Qatar Islamic Bank,(7) and others. ■ The basis for allowing price quotations be submitted in the name of customer is because such an act has no contractual effect if there is no acceptance by the customer. The basis why it is preferred that the quotation be submitted in the name of the Institution, is to avoid confusion and this is what was endorsed by the Fatwas of Qatar Islamic Bank,(8) and Kuwait Finance House.(9) ■ The basis for not allowing a Murabahah deal when the customer accepts the deal directly from the supplier is because, by this, a sale contract has taken place between the customer and the supplier in which case the commodity enters into ownership of the customer. This ruling will not be affected whether or not the customer has paid the price. This is be cause payment is not a condition for the permissibility and conclusion of a contract as payment of the price is but a consequence of a contract and is not principal requirement or a condition for regarding a contract valid. ■ The basis for the requirement that there must not be any contractual com mitment between the customer and the supplier is to safeguard against the contract being a mere interest-based financing. Therefore, the lack of any commitment between the customer and the supplier is a basic con dition for the permissibility of executing a Murabahah by the Institution. ■ The basis for the requirement that the customer must not have any (busi ness) connection with the supplier is to avoid involving in a ’Inah (sell and buy back) transaction that is prohibited by Shari’ah. ■ The basis for the permissibility that the supplier may be a relative of the customer or a husband or wife to the customer is because both parties have independent legal liability unless it has come to be that they are involved in a ’Inah transaction, in which case the transaction is prohibited. This is to defeat a potential intentional arrangement to evade formalities of the transaction. The Fatwa of Kuwait Finance House supports this.(10) ■ The basis for not allowing a partner to promise to buy the shares of another partner on a Murabahah basis is because this will lead to the buyer guaran teeing the share of other partner, which is Riba. ■ The basis for not allowing dealings in gold, silver and currencies on de ferred Murabahah basis is the saying of the Prophet, peace be upon him, in respect to exchange of gold with silver that such exchange take place “hand to hand”;(11) i.e., without delay in delivery, and the rules of cur rencies are subsumed under the ruling for gold and silver. This ruling is rencies are subsumed under the ruling for gold and silver. This ruling is endorsed by the resolution of the International Fiqh Academy.(12) ■ The basis for the prohibition of Murabahah tradable securities or refinancing of a Murabahah transaction is because these fall under the heading of sale of debt that is prohibited by Shari’ah. ■ The basis for not allowing a bilateral binding promise is because it amounts to a contract prior to acquisition of the item to be sold. The International Fiqh Academy has issued a resolution in this respect.(13) ■ The basis for the permissibility of the agreement to amend the terms of the The basis for the permissibility of the agreement to amend the terms of the promise is because a promise is not a contract and as such the amendment of the profit margin and the duration will not amount to rescheduling of debt which is prohibited by Shari’ah. ■ The basis for using options when buying on Murabahah is the case of Hib ban Ibn Munqidh when the Prophet (peace be upon him), said to him: “If you buy, a condition that there is no cheating and that you have a three day period for any of the goods bought. If you are satisfied, then keep it and if you are not satisfied, return it to the buyer.”(14) The ruling on the application of option in Murabahah is endorsed by a resolution issued during the second Fiqh Forum organised by Kuwait Finance House. ■ The basis for the impermissibility of a commitment fee is because such a fee The basis for the impermissibility of a commitment fee is because such a fee is in exchange for the right to contract, which is a mere intention and wish that is not a subject of exchange. ■ The basis for the impermissibility of a facility commission is because it is The basis for the impermissibility of a facility commission is because it is not allowed to receive commission in the event of giving out a loan facility itself. It is therefore a logical conclusion to disallow commission for a mere readiness to finance the customer on a deferred payment basis. ■ The basis for allowing that the expenses of preparing the document of contracts between the Institution and the customer be borne by the two parties is because both parties will equally benefit from this, and more over there is no any impermissible act involved. The basis for the permis sibility that these expenses may be borne by one of the parties is because this is a form of condition that is permissible. ■ The basis for the permissibility of the customer guaranteeing the good performance of the supplier is because this guarantee secures rights and does not adversely affect any rules of the Murabahah transaction. ■ The basis for not allowing that the customer guarantee the risk of trans portation of the goods is because the safety of the goods is the responsi bility of the owner and the customer is not the owner. Hence, the owner must bear the risk since the right to profit is associated with bearing risk. ■ The basis for the permissibility of Hamish Jiddiyyah (security deposit) is because it is a form of guarantee for any financial damage that may occur. ■ The basis for the permissibility of obtaining the earnest money to secure performance is the practice of Umar Ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) in the presence of some companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him,(15) which has been permitted by Imam Ahmad. A resolution has been issued in connection with the permissibility of ’Arboun (Earnest Money) by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy.(16) Acquisition of Title to, and Possession of, the Asset by the Institution or its Agent ■ The basis for the prohibition of selling a commodity before taking possession is the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Do not sell what you own not”(17) and the Hadith in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibits a person from selling what he does not own.(18) The basis for preferring that the Institution appoint an agent other than the purchase orderer in case of the need to do so is to avoid a fictitious transaction that shows on paper that the acquisition is made on behalf of the Institution. This is necessary in order that the Institution appear as the real purchaser and in order to demarcate the liabilities of the parties, the liability of the Institution and the liability of the purchase orderer after the sale contract. ■ The basis for the requirement that the Institution must pay the supplier directly is to avoid the risk of the contract degenerating into mere interest based financing. ■ The basis for the requirement that the liabilities of the parties -in case the Institution acquires the goods through agency- is to demarcate the two liabilities. ■ The basis for the requirement that documents must be directed to the Institution is because the purchase is taking place on behalf of the institution. ■ The basis for the requirement that the agent must explain to the supplier his agency status is to control the transaction and to determine the party to be referred to for the execution of the contract. ■ The basis for the requirement of possession before a sale contract is to ensure that the Institution becomes liable for the risk of destruction of the commodity before it is entitled to sell it. ■ The basis for separating an agency contract from a Murabahah transac tion is to be sure that there is no any intentional arrangement to connect the two contracts. ■ The basis for the rule that constructive possession is sufficient to meet the requirement of possession and that possession is according to the nature of the items is because the Shari’ah did not state a particular form for pos session. Rather this is left to the customary practices. Again, the purpose of possession is to enable one to have control over something. Therefore, any procedure that serves this objective would be regarded as possession. ■ The basis for the requirement that the contract of agency be separate from the contract of sale on a Murabahah basis is because of the risk that the contracts may be connected to each other. ■ The basis for the rule that the Institution bear the expenses of insurance is because these expenses follow ownership of the goods. Conclusion of a Murabahah Contract ■ The basis for the rule that the Institution is entitled to compensation in case of breach of a binding promise by the customer to buy the goods is because of the damage that may be inflicted on the Institution due to the act of the customer. This is because the customer has caused the Institu tion to enter into a deal that it would not have concluded in the absence of the promise. The International Islamic Fiqh Academy has issued a res olution in this respect.(19) ■ The basis for the rule that the Institution’s rights are limited, in case of breach of promise, to the difference between the cost of the item to the Institution and its selling price to a third party is because the lawful right in a guarantee is limited to the amount that compensates for the damage suffered and because the Institution’s right to recover loss of its mark-up is irrational since there is no mark-up unless there is actually a Muraba hah transaction and in this case there is no such transaction. ■ The basis for the requirement of transparency as to the cost price is The basis for the requirement of transparency as to the cost price is because Murabahah is a trust related contract that requires disclosure of the amount and the currency of the cost price because a price in a deferred payment sale is higher. ■ The basis for allowing normal expenses to be included in computing the selling price of the commodity is because these expenses are paid to a third party. ■ The basis for entitlement of the buyer to benefit from the discount acquired by the Institution is because Murabahah is a mark-up sale. Therefore, if the previous purchasing price decreases then the cost price is the amount that remains after the discount and this price is the cost price for the purpose of the Murabahah. ■ The basis for the requirement that the price and the profit in Murabahah must be determined is to avoid uncertainty and lack of knowledge. ■ The basis for the requirement that the profit must be separately disclosed from the cost price and that it is not allowed to be calculated as a single amount for the customer is because Murabahah is a sale with a profit margin. Therefore, it is necessary this profit be disclosed separately to ensure that the customer will agree to it. ■ The basis for the permissibility of instalment payment is because Mu The basis for the permissibility of instalment payment is because Mu rabahah is one of the sale contracts that are subject to spot payment, deferred payment or instalment payment. The basis for the impermissi deferred payment or instalment payment. The basis for the impermissi bility of requesting an additional sum of money for delay in payment is bility of requesting an additional sum of money for delay in payment is because this is the prohibited Riba. ■ The basis for the permissibility of stipulating a defect exclusion item is The basis for the permissibility of stipulating a defect exclusion item is because a buyer is entitled to require guaranteeing hidden defects which are related to the sold commodity by the seller. However, the buyer may relinquish this right by agreeing to a defect exclusion item, as stated by a number of scholars.(20) ■ The basis for the permissibility of stipulating that the contract would be terminated for default in payment is because the original principle in respect to stipulations is validity and permissibility. In addition, this item does not render permissible an impermissible act or prohibit a permissible act. Hence, this item falls under the Hadith that says: “Mus lims are bound by the conditions they made, except a condition that renders permissible an impermissible act or prohibits a permissible act.(21) Guarantees in Murabahah and Treatment of Murabahah Receivables ■ The basis for the condition that all instalments will become due if there is delay in payment is the Hadith of the Prophet, peace be upon him: Mus lims are bound by the conditions they made, and because payment on a deferred basis is the right of the buyer, and the buyer may choose to pay before time and relinquish the deferral of the date of payment entirely or make payment of all instalments contingent on default on payment of one instalment. ■ The basis for demanding collateral to secure payment is because such a requirement does not affect the contract; rather, it consolidates perfor mance and such guarantees are relevant to contracts involving credit. ■ The basis for not allowing a stipulation that delays transfer of ownership is because such a stipulation is against the effect of a sale contract, which is immediate transfer of ownership. The basis for allowing the Institution to hold up registering the commodity in the name of the customer until payment is realised is that such an action does not affect the transfer of ownership to the buyer. ■ The basis for the permissibility of stipulating a condition, whereby the debtor in case of default is obliged to donate a sum of money in addition to the amount of the debt to be spent by the Institution on charitable causes, is because this has been considered as an instance of the commitment to make a donation, which is well established in the Maliki school of law. This is the opinion of Abu Abdullah Ibn Nafi’ and Muhammad Ibn Ibrahim Ibn Dinar, among the Maliki jurists.(22) ■ The basis for the prohibition of additional payment over the principal The basis for the prohibition of additional payment over the principal debt in consideration for extension of time is because such action is a pre-Islamic form of Riba. ■ The basis for the permissibility of discount or rebate for earlier payment The basis for the permissibility of discount or rebate for earlier payment is because discount for early payment is a form of settlement between the creditor and the debtor to pay less than the amount of the debt. This is among the settlement that are endorsed by Shari’ah as stated in the case of Ubay Ibn Ka’b (may Allah be pleased with him) and his debtor where the Prophet (peace be upon him) suggested to him in words: “write off a portion of your debt.”(23) The International Islamic Fiqh Academy has issued a resolution in support of this rule.(24) ■ The basis of the permissibility of payment of debt in another currency is The basis of the permissibility of payment of debt in another currency is that this would entail the settlement of the debt by discharging it. This does not involve any prohibited transaction pertaining to debts either with regard to sale or purchase. As for some of the forms mentioned in the standard, there are texts to support them, inter alia, the Hadith reported on the authority of Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “I have met the Prophet (peace be upon him) at the house of Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with her), and I said to him: ‘O Prophet of Allah, I would like to ask you: ‘I sell a camel in Al-Baqi’ for a price quoted in dinar but I take dirham, and I sell for a price quoted in dirham but I take dinars, I take this from this and I give this from this.’ The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied: ‘There is no objection to your taking the other currency based on the price of the day, provided you do not leave each other with something remaining owed as a debt between you’.”(25) Some of the forms in the standard are a kind of set-off and this is permissible.",

The banking Murabahah involves deferred payment terms, but such deferred payment is not one of the essential conditions of such transaction, as there is also a Murabahah arranged with no deferral of payment. In this case, the seller only receives a mark-up that only includes the profit for a spot sale and not the extra charge it would, otherwise, receive for deferral of payment. Commitment Fee A commitment fee is the percentage or amount which the Institution takes from the customer to start processing the transaction even though a sale contract may not be concluded). ’Arboun The term ’Arboun means an amount of money that the customer as purchase orderer pays to the Institution after concluding the Murabahah sale, with the provision that if the sale is completed during a prescribed period, the amount will be counted as part of the price. If the customer fails to execute the Murabahah sale, then the Institution may retain the whole amount. Syndicated Financing A syndicated financing is a partnership relationship for financing a particular project which two or more parties has interest to finance. They will distribute the profit or revenue as per agreement. In other words, syndicated financing is the acceptance of a number of companies (financial Institutions) to enter into a joint investment transaction through one of the permissible investment instruments with an understanding that one of the parties assumes leadership of the deal. During the period of the transaction, the transaction would enjoy an independent liability separated from their companies. Credit Facility A credit facility is an upper limit for a customer’s Murabahah transac tions. This credit facility may be restricted to a specified type of item, or to a specified period of time.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Permissibility of Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek ■ Ijarah derives permissibility from the Qur`an, the Sunnah, consensus of Fuqaha and Ijtihad (reasoning). ■ On the level of the Qur`an, Allah, the Almighty, says: {“said one of them ‘O my father engage him on wages”},(3) and {“if you had wished, surely you could have exacted some recompense for it”}.(4) ■ The authority for the permissibility of Ijarah in the Sunnah is the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Whoever hired a worker must inform him of his wages”,(5) and his saying: “Give a worker his wages before his sweat (body odour) is dried”.(6) ■ The permissibility of Ijarah also generated consensus among the legal The permissibility of Ijarah also generated consensus among the legal community. The Ijarah is also acceptable by reasoning because it is a convenient means for people to acquire right to use assets that they do not own since not all people may be able to own tangible assets. ■ The Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek, on the other hand, is not different in its rules from an ordinary Ijarah, except that it is associated with a promise by the lessor to transfer ownership at the end of the Ijarah term. The permissibility of this form of Ijarah is confirmed by the resolution of International Islamic Fiqh Academy which explained the impermissible and the permissible forms of Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek.(7) ■ It must be noted that the permissible Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek is different from hire-purchase as commonly practised by the conventional banks in the following respects. In hire-purchase, the terms and provisions of sale and leasing are applied to the subject matter at the same time, and subsequently the ownership of the subject matter is transferred to the lessee (buyer), once he pays the last instalment without the need for a separate contract for the transfer of ownership. In the permissible Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek, on the other hand, the provisions governing Ijarah are applied to the leased asset until the end of the Ijarah term, after which the lessee obtains ownership of the asset in the manner explained in this Standard. ■ It must be noted also that the Ijarah contract intended in this Standard is the lease of tangible assets (chattels or property), which is a contract giving a legal title to legitimate and identified usufruct for a defined period of time in exchange for a legitimate and determined consideration. Promise to Lease an Asset The basis for allowing the Institution to demand payment of money by a party who has promised to take the property as lessee is the need to confirm the commitment of the promissor. This is because a binding promise has financial implications if the promissor retracts the promise. The request for payment of a commitment fee is to cater for financial damage that the Institution may have incurred as a result of the promissor taking back the promise or defaulting in payment. The unified Shari’ah Supervisory Board of Al Baraka issued a Fatwa in respect to Hamish Jiddiyyah (security deposit) in Murabahah.(8) This ruling is also applicable to Ijarah. Acquisition of the Asset to be Leased, or Its Usufruct, by the Institution ■ The basis for not allowing the leasing of an asset that is not owned by the lessor is the Hadith that prohibits one from selling what he does not own,(9) and Ijarah proper is a sale of usufruct. The basis for allowing the leasing back of an asset to the person from whom the asset was acquired is because such a transaction does not involve any ’Inah sale. ■ The basis for not allowing a simultaneous combination of Ijarah and sale is because making purchase contracts contingent upon leasing contracts is impermissible by an explicit text in the view of a number of jurists. This is prohibited by a well-known Hadith which prohibits two sales in one sale.(10) ■ The basis for the permissibility of sub-leasing when the lessor has The basis for the permissibility of sub-leasing when the lessor has allowed it is because the lessee has ownership of the usufruct by virtue of the Ijarah contract, in which case he is entitled to transfer such usufruct for consideration as he deems fit. The basis for impermissibility of sub for consideration as he deems fit. The basis for impermissibility of sub leasing when the lessor has not allowed it is because the ownership of usufruct by the lessee is limited in which case the lessee is obliged to consider any limitations on this ownership. ■ The basis for the permissibility of leasing a property on the basis of The basis for the permissibility of leasing a property on the basis of specifications even if the lessor does not own it is that this will not lead to dispute, in which case it is similar to a Salam contract. However, in this case the lessor should not request advance payment of the rentals this case the lessor should not request advance payment of the rentals according to one of the views of the Shafi’is and Hanbalis. ■ The basis for preferring that the agent who purchases on behalf of the Institution be someone other than the customer (lessee) is to avoid fictitious transactions and to demonstrate the genuine role of the Insti tution in making the usufruct of the asset available to the lessee. Contract of Ijarah ■ The basis for the binding nature of an Ijarah contract is because Ijarah is one of the contracts for transferring ownership that depends on an exchange of counter-values. The Shari’ah principle is that these contracts are binding because of the Saying of Allah, the Almighty: {“... Fulfil (your) obligations...”}.(11) The basis for allowing cancellation of an Ijarah contract due to contingencies is because without the right to cancel the Ijarah contract the lessee would waste money by paying rent for unneeded usufruct due to an event of which he did not contribute to the occurrence. ■ The basis for requiring a designated term for the lease is because without such a designated term there would be an uncertainty that might lead to dispute. The basis for allowing an Ijarah contract take effect based on future events is because Ijarah is, unlike a sale contract, a contract that involves time and for this it is relevant that it be contingent on future events. ■ The basis for the permissibility of obtaining ’Arboun (Earnest Money) to secure performance is the practice of Umar Ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) in the presence of some companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him). This practice is also permitted by Imam Ahmad. A resolution has been issued in connection with the permis sibility of ’Arboun (Earnest Money) by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy.(12) ■ The basis for the impermissibility of re-leasing after the lease of the asset is that under the first contract, the usufruct of the asset no longer belongs to the owner, and a new contract may not be signed with another lessee before the contract with the first lessee is terminated. Hence, this form of Ijarah is not suitable as an investment instrument, because it constitutes an impermissible sale of the rent receivable pursuant to providing new lessees with an asset already leased out to the existing lessee. The form just described is different from the transfer, by the owner, of the ownership of the leased assets to an investor, so that the latter takes his place, wholly or partially, with regard to the ownership of all or some parts of the assets, as well as in the ownership of the usufruct of, and entitlement to his share of the rent from, those assets. Al Baraka Forum has issued a resolution disallowing multiple leases of the same asset after the first Ijarah contract.(13) ■ The basis for allowing successive leases on the same specified usufruct of The basis for allowing successive leases on the same specified usufruct of a particular asset without specifying a particular period for a particular person is because the usufruct -in line with the term assigned to each party- can accommodate the parties. The justification for not allowing a specific term for each person is that each party will know the term to which he is entitled in his turn and because their applications are considered in order. This rule was supported by a resolution of Al Baraka Forum.(14) ■ The basis for the requirement that incorporating co-lessees must take place before any sub-lease contract is signed is because sub-leasing the property means the sub-lessor no longer owns the usufruct, and thus he would be leasing out a benefit of the usufruct that he does not own, which is not permissible in Shari’ah as stated earlier. The jurists have considered a bankrupt lessor -a person who leases things he does not own- among those who must be restricted in using their property. Subject Matter of Ijarah ■ The basis for the requirement that the leased asset must be capable of being used while preserving the asset is that the subject of a lease is usufruct and not the asset, as leasing is not possible for things that perish by use. The basis for the requirement that benefit from Ijarah must be permissible is that leasing an asset that will be used in impermissible permissible is that leasing an asset that will be used in impermissible way makes the lessor an accomplice in doing evil and this is prohibited as per the saying of Allah, the Almighty: {“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety)”}.(15) ■ The basis for the impermissibility of stipulating a defect exclusion The basis for the impermissibility of stipulating a defect exclusion clause in respect to the leased asset is that such a condition defeats the purpose of the contract, which is exchange of usufruct for rentals. If the usufruct is partially or wholly impaired, the receipt of the rentals by the lessor becomes a form of unjust enrichment. The resolution of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy has declared that the lessor must accept responsibility for any destruction or impairment of the leased asset insofar as these events are not sustained as a result of misconduct or negligence on the part of the lessee.(16) The Fatwa of the unified Shari’ah Supervisory Board of Al Baraka states that the lessor is not entitled to exclude his liability in respect of defects in the leased asset.(17) ■ The reason why the lessor may not stipulate that the lessee will undertake the major maintenance of the leased asset is that this condition defeats the purpose of an Ijarah contract. Again, it is the duty of the lessor to ensure that the usufruct is intact, and this is not possible unless the asset is maintained and kept safe so that the lessor may be entitled to the rentals in consideration for the usufruct. The unified Shari’ah Supervisory Board of Al Baraka issued a fatwa supporting this.(18) ■ The reason why insurance expenses must be borne by the lessor is that the owner of the asset is responsible for insuring it, and the lessor is the owner. This is supported by the resolution issued by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy.(19) ■ The basis for the permissibility of using a certain benchmark or price index to determine rentals of subsequent periods after the expiration of the first period of an Ijarah contract is that the rentals will subsequently be known. This is similar to the principle of Ujrat al Mithl (prevailing market rate of rental) and does not lead to dispute. Again, using a benchmark to determine the rentals is to the benefit of all parties since there is possibility of rental fluctuation that may be in favour of either the lessee or the lessor in view of the fact that the contract remains binding on both parties throughout its term. This rule is supported by a Fatwa issued during Al Baraka’s 11th Forum. ■ The basis for the permissibility of restructuring the rentals for the The basis for the permissibility of restructuring the rentals for the future periods is that such an act is deemed to create a new contract for a new term for which the rentals are not yet due. Hence, the rentals are not regarded as a debt, in which case the prohibition of rescheduling rentals in return for higher payment is not applicable to this. However, increasing previously agreed rentals in exchange for a deferred period of payment is a form of Riba. Guarantees and Treatment of Ijarah Receivables ■ The basis for the permissibility of obtaining guarantees for payment The basis for the permissibility of obtaining guarantees for payment is that this is not contrary to the purpose of an Ijarah contract. Rather guarantees are relevant to credit transactions because they secure per formance. ■ The basis for the permissibility of a payment acceleration clause is the The basis for the permissibility of a payment acceleration clause is the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Muslims are bound by the conditions they made”, and because payment on a deferred basis is the right of the lessee (the debtor as to rentals), and the lessee may, based on agreement, choose to pay before time and relinquish the deferral of the date of payment entirely. The lessee may also agree to a stipulation that bases acceleration of payment on the event of default in payment. ■ The basis of the prohibition of increasing the amount of lease receivables in exchange for a deferral of payment is because this is a form of Riba. ■ The basis for the permissibility of stipulating that a solvent debtor The basis for the permissibility of stipulating that a solvent debtor should undertake to make a payment to charity in case of default is that this is similar to an undertaking to make a donation that is approved by the Maliki scholars, notably Abdullah Ibn Nafi’ and Muhammad Ibn Ibrahim Ibn Dinar.(20) Changes to the Ijarah Contract ■ The basis for allowing the lessor to sell the leased asset to a third party The basis for allowing the lessor to sell the leased asset to a third party without the consent of the lessee is that the lessor owns the asset and is acting within the limits of his ownership without affecting the right of the lessee that is materialised in the usufruct. If the Ijarah expires, enabling the buyer to take possession of the asset is sufficient to discharge the seller from any responsibility as to delivery in which case the buyer will own the asset excluding the right of the lessee to the usufruct which is attached to the asset even if the ownership is transferred. The Shari’ah Supervisory Board of Al Rajhi Banking and Investment Corp.,(21) and the Shari’ah Supervisory Board of the Jordan Islamic Bank(22) have issued a resolution in support of this ruling. ■ The basis for the termination of the lease contract due to a total destruc tion of the leased asset is that the rent is in consideration of the benefit of the leased asset and if the latter is destroyed, there is no justification for the payment of the rental. ■ The basis for the entitlement of the lessor to the rentals even though The basis for the entitlement of the lessor to the rentals even though the lessee returns the leased asset to the owner or stops using it is that Ijarah is a binding contract that cannot be terminated unilaterally by the lessee. ■ The basis for the permissibility of terminating the lease contract in case of intervening contingencies or force majeure is that there is a pressing need which calls for this. This is because if the contract were to be bin ding in spite of such contingencies, then a person with a valid excuse may incur loss that was not a result of a contract. The Shari’ah Super visory Board of the Kuwait Finance House(23) and the unified Shari’ah Supervisory Board of Al Baraka(24) have issued a supporting Fatwa in this regard. ■ The basis for the permissibility that the lessor may stipulate that an The basis for the permissibility that the lessor may stipulate that an Ijarah contract be terminated due to non-payment of rental by the lessee is that contractual stipulations are primarily valid and enforceable. This stipulation does not legalise impermissible acts or invalidate permissible stipulation does not legalise impermissible acts or invalidate permissible acts. Therefore, the permissibility of this stipulation comes under the prophetic Hadith stating: “Muslims are bound by the conditions they made except a condition that legalises impermissible act or invalidates permissible act”.(25) ■ The basis of the rule that Ijarah does not terminate with the death of either party thereto is that the subject-matter of the contract is the asset and as long as the asset is available the Ijarah contract remains unaffected. The basis for the right of the lessee’s heirs to terminate the Ijarah if they The basis for the right of the lessee’s heirs to terminate the Ijarah if they can prove that the contract has become too onerous for their resources is to avoid inflicting damage on the heirs. This exceptional ruling is taken from the Maliki School of law since it serves the interests of the lessee. The heirs of the lessor may not terminate the Ijarah in the event of the death of the lessor because there is no potential damage to them, as they will receive the rentals for the remainder of the term of the contract. Transfer of the Ownership in the Leased Asset in Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek ■ The basis of the rule that the documents of the lessor’s promise to sell and the methods of transfer of ownership be separated from the Ijarah contract is to ensure that the obligations and liabilities are not linked to each other. The International Islamic Fiqh Academy has issued a resolution in this regard.(26) ■ The basis for the rule that the promise of a client to take an asset acquired by the Institution on lease is binding is that the Institution has acquired the asset in order to lease it to the client due to the promise. Therefore, the rule that the promise to take the asset on lease is binding will protect the promisee. ■ The basis for not allowing bilateral promises is that the resemblance of these promises to a contract, i.e. a contract is effected before taking ownership of the subject matter of the contract. The International Islamic Fiqh Academy has issued a resolution in this regard.(27) ■ The basis for the permissibility of a gift contingent upon the expiry of the Ijarah term is that a conditional gift is valid. The Prophet (peace be upon him) sent a gift to Negus (the former emperor of Ethiopia) on condition that he was alive at the time of the arrival of the messenger.(28) The basis for the permissibility of leasing an asset to the person from The basis for the permissibility of leasing an asset to the person from whom it is purchased by way of Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek on condition that the parties observe the lapse of a period of time is that this prevents the contract from becoming a ’Inah transaction. This is because the physical changes to the asset or changes in the value of the asset during this period give it the economic characteristics of a different asset. ■ The basis for the requirement that all the rules prescribed for an ordinary lease are applicable to Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek is that a mere promise to transfer ownership does exclude the contract from becoming an Ijarah contract or from the applicable rules. This requirement is necessary in order to prevent a linking of contracts (the sale contract and lease contract). The International Islamic Fiqh Academy has issued a resolution in support of this ruling.(29) ■ The basis for the rule that ownership cannot be made in contingent on a future date is that a sale contract cannot be dependent on a future date, as the term ‘sale’ means that its effect (transfer of ownership) immediately takes place. ■ The basis for allowing recourse to the prevailing market rate of rental when the transfer of ownership becomes impossible without any cause attributable to the lessee is to protect the lessee against any loss as the lessee has paid more than the prevailing rate of rental in order to acquire title to the asset. If this acquisition of title becomes impossible, then the rental must be adjusted retrospectively to the prevailing market rate. This ruling is analogous to the principle that the price must be discounted when a sold crop has suffered damages due natural calamities.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Permissibility of Salam A contract of Salam derives its permissibility from the Qur`an, the Sunnah and Ijma’ (consensus of Fuqaha). On the level of the Qur`an, Allah, the Almighty, says: {“O ye who believe! When you deal with each other, in transactions involving future obligations in a fixed period time, reduce them to writing”}.(2) Ibn Abbas said: “I declare that a Salaf (Salam) contract in which the commodity is guaranteed for future delivery has been permitted by Allah” and then he read: {“O ye who believe! When you deal with each other, in transactions involving future obligations in a fixed period time, reduce them to writing”}. It is reported that Ibn Abbas said: “This verse is a revelation for the particular purpose of making Salam permissible.”(3) On the level of Sunnah, Ibn Abbas is reported to have said: “The Prophet (peace be upon him) has came to Medina and found that people were selling dates for deferred delivery after a duration of one or two years on a Salam basis. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: ‘Whoever pays for dates on a deferred delivery basis (Salam) should do so on the basis of a specified scale and weight’”. In another text of the Hadith the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Whoever pays on a deferred delivery basis should do so on the basis of a specified scale, weight and date of delivery”.(4) The scholars are unanimous on the permissibility of a Salam contract. Ibn Mundhir said that the scholars agreed that a Salam contract -i.e, a contract in which a person sells to his fellow man a specific and determined thing by weight or measure for a future defined date of delivery—is permissible. Wisdom of Making Salam Permissible The wisdom of making Salam permissible lies in the fact that Salam facilitates a type of financing for people in need of it. In particular, farmers, market gardeners and merchants, among others, need working capital for their businesses and for their living expenses in order to operate. Hence, Salam is made permissible so that these businesses may benefit from it. The buyer may benefit from its permissibility as well, by acquiring the commodity at a price below the market price. Similarly, a contract of Salam responds to the needs of a large number of business enterprises at different levels, ranging from small and medium sized enterprises to conglomerates that are involved in agricultural and industrial production or trade and the like. In order for these businesses to be productive, they need working capital in the form of either cash or assets. Hence, Salam has provided an investment opportunity in the form of financing of the working capital for trade. It also covers the demands of those in need of liquidity, as long as they are able to fulfill the orders they receive in return at the due date. Although the contract of Salam is commonly used by agricultural busi nesses, its permissibility is not, however, confined to these fields. It can also be used in other investment opportunities, such as industry or trade. The contract of Salam also meets immediate needs for liquidity. This is The contract of Salam also meets immediate needs for liquidity. This is because it gives the seller flexibility in using the sale proceeds (before the commodity is delivered), and the opportunity to arrange for the counter value (al-Muslam Fihi) and its delivery to the buyer at the date of delivery. Subject Matter of a Salam Contract ■ The basis for the permissibility of presenting usufruct as capital in The basis for the permissibility of presenting usufruct as capital in a Salam contract is the view of the Maliki scholars. This is regarded as immediate receipt of the capital based on the Shari’ah maxim that says: “Taking possession of part of a thing is like taking possession of the whole thing”.(6) Hence, this is not a sale of debt (because the buyer has received control over the usufruct).(7) ■ The basis for the requirement that the capital of Salam must be known to the two parties is that a Salam contract is one of the exchange contracts in which the consideration need to be known so as to remove any uncertainty.(8) ■ The basis for the requirement that the capital must be paid at the conclusion of a Salam contract is the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Whoever pays on a deferred delivery basis should do so on the basis of specifying the scale”.(9) The Taslif or Islaf means payment in advance. Salam was so named because the capital must be paid in advance. If payment is delayed, the transaction is not called Salam.(10) Again, any delay in payment of the capital and dispersal of the parties renders the transaction a sale of debt for debt(11) which is prohibited, and the scholars agreed on its prohibition. Ibn Rushd said: “As for sale of debt for debt, Muslim scholars are unanimous regarding its prohibition”.(12) ■ The basis for it not being permitted that a debt be capital in Salam is because this would render the transaction a form of sale of debt and this is prohibited by the Shari’ah. ■ The basis for the impermissibility of Salam where the subject matter is The basis for the impermissibility of Salam where the subject matter is a specific and identified thing is the Hadith stating that “A man came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said; ‘The kin of so and so from the Jews had embraced Islam. However, they are hungry and I am afraid they may become apostates’. The Prophet (peace be upon him) asked the people around him; ‘Who has something (money)?’ One Jew said; ‘I have so and so (he mentioned a sum of money), may be he said; ‘I have three hundred dinars and I will pay such and such price for the products of the farm of the kin of so and so’. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: ‘(buy) With such and such price to be delivered after such and such period, but not for the products of the kin of so and so’”.(13) Again, if a Salam contract is concluded for providing products from a specific farm, there might not be products from this farm at the time of delivery, and this leads to Gharar (uncertainty). ■ The basis for the requirement that the subject-matter of Salam be com The basis for the requirement that the subject-matter of Salam be com monly available under normal circumstances where it is required is to remove uncertainty and to ensure that the seller will be able to deliver it at the date of delivery. Changes to a Salam Contract ■ The basis for the impermissibility of selling the subject-matter of Salam The basis for the impermissibility of selling the subject-matter of Salam before taking possession of it is because such an action is a form of sale of debts which is not permissible. ■ The basis for the impermissibility of substituting the subject-matter of The basis for the impermissibility of substituting the subject-matter of Salam with a commodity, the price of which is higher than the prevalent market value of the subject-matter of Salam at the date of delivery is to deter the buyer from making a compound profit on one deal. ■ The basis for the permissibility of the termination of a Salam by The basis for the permissibility of the termination of a Salam by agreement (Iqalah) is because the Prophet (peace be upon him) has encouraged Iqalah in general and Salam is not an exception from this concession. Salam is also a form of sale and since sale contracts admit Iqalah, so too does a Salam contract. Again, Iqalah is actually permitted for the sale of tangible goods in consideration of the need of contracting parties to be able to deal with regret and a desire to withdraw from the contract. In the case of Salam, the possibility that the parties may regret concluding the transactions is greater than in the sale of tangible goods because Salam is a low cost form of sale for which permissibility of Iqalah is easily applicable in Salam.(14) Delivery of al-Muslam Fihi The basis for not allowing penalty clauses in Salam is because al-Muslam Fihi is considered to be a debt; and it is not permitted to stipulate payment in excess of the principal amount of debts. Parallel Salam ■ The basis for the permissibility of Parallel Salam is that it represents two Salam deals that are separable from each other despite the fact that the descriptions of the subject-matter in the two contracts are similar. However, the contract does not lead to two sales in one, which is impermissible. ■ The basis for the impermissibility of tradeable Salam Sukuk is because trading with such Sukuk is a form of sale of debt which is prohibited. (14) See: Al-Kasani, “Bada`i’ Al-Sana`i’” [5: 214].",

It is a type of sale in which the price, known as the Salam capital, is paid at the time of contracting while the delivery of the item to be sold, known as al-Muslam Fihi (the subject-matter of a Salam contract), is deferred. The seller and the buyer are known as al Muslam Ilaihi and al-Muslam or Rab al-Salam respectively. Salam is also known as Salaf (literally; borrowing). Parallel Salam If the seller enters into another separate Salam contract with a third party to acquire goods, the specification of which corresponds to that of the commodity specified in the first Salam contract, so that he (the seller) can fulfil his obligation under that contract, then this second contract is called, in contemporary custom, Parallel Salam or Salam Muwazi. The following is an example of such a contract. An Institution on one hand buys a specified quantity of cotton from farmers on a Salam basis and, in turn, the buyer in the first Salam contract enters into a new separate Salam contract with textile mills so as to provide them, by means of that new Salam contract, with cotton, the specifications of which are similar to the specifications of the cotton to be acquired under the first Salam contract, without making the execution of the second Salam contract contingent on the execution of the first Salam contract. Iqalah Iqalah or cancellation of a contract is a bilateral agreement of the contract ing parties to abate and remove the legal effect of a contract. Mithlis (Fungibles) Items that are mutually interchangeable, i.e., items whose units are identical (in specifications), and if destructed, are guaranteed by other identical units without consideration to their value.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Legitimacy of Istisna’a Contract The legitimacy of Istisna’a is based on the request of the Prophet (peace The legitimacy of Istisna’a is based on the request of the Prophet (peace be upon him) that a pulpit (a platform) for preaching and a finger ring be upon him) that a pulpit (a platform) for preaching and a finger ring be manufactured for him.(2) An Istisna’a contract is also permissible on the basis of the principle of Istihsan (Shari’ah approbation), the general principles of contracts and transactions and the objectives of Shari’ah. The Istisna’a is a binding contract and not a mere promise. The International Islamic Fiqh Academy has issued a resolution in support of the legitimacy of Istisna’a.(3) Istisna’a Contract ■ The basis for it not being permissible that the role of the Institution remain as a mere financier for a deal concluded between the supplier and the ultimate purchaser is that this would lead to involvement in a Riba transaction which makes the Istisna’a contract a mere cover-up and not a real Istisna’a. ■ The basis for stating that an Istisna’a contract is binding is the view of Imam Abu Yusuf, as stated in the “Majjalat Al-Ahkam Al-’Adliyyah”, (known in English by the name the Mejelle), that the manufacturer has spent money in order to manufacture and to deliver according to speci fication. If the ultimate purchaser has a right to refuse the manufactured goods, then the manufacturer will incur losses. ■ The basis for the impermissibility of the manufacturer including a defect The basis for the impermissibility of the manufacturer including a defect exclusion clause in an Istisna’a contract is that a valid Istisna’a is a sale of specified goods to be delivered in the future and exclusion of liability as to defects is valid only in the sale of particular identified goods. This prohibition of excluding liability as to defects in Istisna’a is one feature that makes it different from an ordinary sale. ■ The basis for the impermissibility of drawing up Istisna’a contracts or The basis for the impermissibility of drawing up Istisna’a contracts or procedures in a way that appears to be a mere interest-based financing is the need to avoid involvement in a Riba transaction, a potential Riba is the need to avoid involvement in a Riba transaction, a potential Riba or ’Inah sales. Subject Matter of, and Guarantees in, an Istisna’a Contract ■ The basis for the impermissibility of concluding an Istisna’a contract The basis for the impermissibility of concluding an Istisna’a contract for items that are not manufactured or constructed is that items that are not the subject of transformation by manufacture or construction by man, that is natural things such as animals, fruits and vegetables, are not by definition covered by the term Istisna’a which means a sale of materials on condition that they be subjected to transformation by a manufacturing or construction process. ■ The basis for the permissibility of concluding an Istisna’a for manufac tured items that either have or do not have equivalents in the market is because it is normal for people to deal in these kinds of item. As a principle, rules that are based on customary practice will change whe never such customary practice is changed. Therefore, any customary transaction that is subject to specifications may be a subject-matter of Istisna’a, regardless of whether it is for use or consumption. ■ The basis for not allowing the subject-matter of Istisna’a to be a specific The basis for not allowing the subject-matter of Istisna’a to be a specific identified item is that an Istisna’a contract involves a sale for future delivery based on a specification. Therefore, if the items to be sold are specific identified items, the transaction involves selling identified items that the seller does not own, which is prohibited by the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Do not sell what you own not”. Again, items to be manufactured or constructed do not yet exist and thus cannot be specific and identified. The non-existent item is to be produced and delivered later and this constitutes a non-monetary obligation of the supplier.(5) ■ The basis for the permissibility of a stipulation by the ultimate purchaser that the manufacture be carried out by the Institution itself is because this stipulation does affect the purpose of the contract. Rather, this condition is relevant in this contract because the ultimate purchaser may be interested in the items that are produced by a particular supplier due to this supplier’s distinguished competence in manufacturing or construction and the quality of the items manufactured or constructed by this supplier. ■ The basis for the permissibility of the manufacturer presenting to the ultimate purchaser either what he has produced or what other parties have produced, if the ultimate purchaser did not stipulate to the contrary, is because this satisfies the purpose of the contract. This is the case because the items are being delivered according to the specifications that are laid down in the contract. ■ The basis for the permissibility of stipulating a time-period during which The basis for the permissibility of stipulating a time-period during which manufacturer remains liable for any manufacturing or construction defects is that such a stipulation serves the purpose of the contract. This is because the ultimate purchaser wants to use the subject-matter and this is not possible unless the subject-matter is free from defects. ■ The basis for the requirement that the price be known is to remove any lack of knowledge and uncertainty that may lead to dispute. ■ The basis for the permissibility in Istisna’a of payment on deferred The basis for the permissibility in Istisna’a of payment on deferred terms or on an instalment basis is that labour (i.e. transformation and added value) is an important part of the items to be sold and this makes the transaction similar to a leasing contract in which it is permissible for the rentals to be paid on a deferred or instalment basis without this being considered as a sale of debt for debt which is prohibited. The same ruling applies to Istisna’a. ■ The basis for the permissibility of offering a difference in the price for The basis for the permissibility of offering a difference in the price for an Istisna’a contract relating to a difference in the date of delivery is that Istisna’a is analogous to an Ijarah contract. The fuqaha have stated that it is permissible to give a labourer in Ijarah an option regarding wages depending on whether the worker finishes the work in one day or in two days. The hirer may say two dinars if the worker finishes in one day or one dinar if he finishes in two days. Istisna’a is similar to this. There is a resolution issued during the Al Baraka Annual Forum supporting this ruling.(6) ■ The basis for not allowing a contract of Istisna’a to be drawn up on the basis of a Murabahah sale, for example, by determining the price of Istisna’a on a cost- plus basis, is because the subject-matter of Murabahah Istisna’a on a cost- plus basis, is because the subject-matter of Murabahah should be something already in existence, the cost of which is known and which is owned prior to the conclusion of a Murabahah sale. An Istisna’a contract, on the other hand, is concluded prior to ownership of the subject-matter, because (I) it is a sale based on a specification giving rise to a future obligation, and (II) the actual cost will be known only after the completion of the work, and, (III) the price in a contract of Istisna’a should be known when the contract is concluded. ■ The basis for deciding that the Institution is not obliged to give a discount when the actual costs of the manufacture are substantially greater than the estimated costs or when it secures a discount from the manufacturer is because the Istisna’a contract and Parallel Istisna’a contract are independent in terms of obligation and effects. The Shari’ah Supervisory Board of the Kuwait Finance House has issued a Fatwa in this respect.(7) ■ The basis for the permissibility of the Institution acquiring all necessary The basis for the permissibility of the Institution acquiring all necessary guarantees is that these guarantees secure its rights and this request does affect the purpose of a contract. Changes to an Istisna’a Contract ■ The basis for the impermissibility of extending the date of payment in The basis for the impermissibility of extending the date of payment in return for consideration is because that is Riba. ■ The basis for the permissibility of discounting for unconditional earlier The basis for the permissibility of discounting for unconditional earlier payment is the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the case of Ubay Ibn Ka’b (may Allah be pleased with him) and his debtor: “Write off a portion of your debt”.(8) The International Islamic Fiqh Academy has issued a resolution in support of this rule.(9) ■ The ultimate purchaser (the owner of the land) is not entitled to acquire ownership of incomplete building structures or utilities that are already in place without giving consideration to the builder if the builder is unable to continue to discharge his obligation. The basis for this is that the construction was initiated by the builder at the request of the ultimate purchaser and such a request is stronger than a mere permission to build on the latter’s land. ■ The basis for the permissibility of a contract of Istisna’a including a clause The basis for the permissibility of a contract of Istisna’a including a clause that the manufacturer is not liable for extra expenses that result from additional conditions inserted into the contract at a later date as a result of directives of the relevant authorities, is because this condition is agreed upon by the parties and does not affect the purpose of Istisna’a contract. The Shari’ah Supervisory Board of Kuwait Finance House has issued a Fatwa in respect to this ruling.(10) ■ The basis for the permissibility of a penalty clause in an Istisna’a contract The basis for the permissibility of a penalty clause in an Istisna’a contract is that such a clause is in the interest of the contract and because it is laid down in respect to an obligation regarding items that must be produced and delivered in the future and not in respect to monetary debt. Supervision of the Execution of an Istisna’a Contract The basis for the permissibility for the Institution, when acting as the ultimate purchaser, to appoint a technically experienced consulting firm and the permissibility for the Institution, when acting as the manufacturer, to appoint the ultimate purchaser as an agent is because agency is permissible and there is nothing against it in an Istisna’a contract provided it is done with the agreement of the parties. Delivery and Disposal of the Subject-Matter The basis for the impermissibility of selling the items to be produced prior to taking either actual or constructive possession of them is that such an action is considered as selling a non-existent item. It is also considered as selling what one does not own because it is not available for the seller at the time of conclusion of the contract. Parallel Istisna’a The basis for the permissibility of the Institution entering into a contract with another party in order to sell, in the capacity of manufacturer, builder or supplier, items whose specification conforms to the wishes of that other party, on the basis of Parallel Istisna’a, is that in such a case there are two separate deals of Istisna’a. There is no link between the two contracts; hence, this is not an instance of two sales in one deal, which is impermissible. The separation of the two contracts also has the effect of making the transaction a type of non-Riba-based financing.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (C) Definitions Istisna’a Contract Istisna’a is a contract of sale of specified items to be manufactured or constructed, with an obligation on the part of the manufacturer or builder (contractor) to deliver them to the customer upon completion. Parallel Istaisna’a Another form of Istisna’a, known in modern custom as Parallel Istisna’a “al-Istisna’a al-Muwazi”, takes effect through two separate contracts. In the first contract, the Islamic Financial Institution acts in the capacity of a manufacturer, builder or supplier and concludes a contract with the customer. In the second contract, the Institution acts in the capacity of a purchaser and concludes another contract with a manufacturer, builder or supplier in order to fulfil its contractual obligations towards the customer in the first contract. By this process, a profit is realised through the difference in price between the two contracts and, in most cases, one of the two contracts is concluded immediately, (i.e. the Istisna’a contract entered into with the manufacturer, builder or supplier), while the second contract (i.e. the contract entered into with the customer) is concluded later. Difference Between Istisna’a and Ijarah The contract of Istisna’a differs from the contract of Ijarah in the sense that the latter is a contract of services without any commitment to supply materials whereas the former requires that the manufacturer or builder provide both services for the transformation or construction process and ultimately to supply the materials in the form of the finished items. Difference Between Istisna’a and a Standard Construction Contract The contract of Istisna’a also differs from a standard construction contract in that the latter is regarded as an Ijarah contract if it is confined to providing services only, with the materials to be provided by the customer (the person who engaged the Institution to carry out the construction work). But if a construction contract requires the builder to provide both the services and the materials needed to fulfil the contract, then it is an Istisna’a contract. Difference Between Istisna’a and Salam The Istisna’a contract also differs from a Salam contract in the sense that the former is a contract that involves a sale of specified items that have by nature to be manufactured or constructed. In other words, an Istisna’a contract is applicable to materials that require transformation by a manufacturing or construction process. The Salam, on the other hand, is a contract of sale of specified goods, the permissibility of which is not attached to a condition that the goods must be manufactured or constructed.",

Partnership of Ownership (Sharikat al-Milk) Partnership of Ownership (Sharikat al-Milk) Partnership of ownership (Sharikat al-Milk) is the combination of the assets of two or more persons in a manner that creates a state of sharing the realised profit or income or benefiting from an increase in the value of the partnership assets. This combination of assets for making profit necessitates bearing losses, if any. The ownership partnership is created by events beyond the partners’ control such as the inheritance rights of heirs in the legacy of a deceased person. This partnership is also created by the wish of the partners such as when two or more parties acquire common shares in a particular asset. Mufawadah Partnership Mufawadah partnership is any partnership in which the parties are equal in all respects, such as funds contributed by them, their right to act and their liability, from the commencement of the partnership to the date of its termination. Sharecropping Partnership (Muzara’ah) Sharecropping is partnership in crops in which one party presents land to another for cultivation and maintenance in consideration for a common defined share in the crop. Irrigating Partnership (Musaqat) Irrigating partnership is a partnership that depends on one party presenting designated plants/trees that produce edible fruits to another in order to work on their irrigation in consideration for a common defined share in the fruits. Agricultural Partnership (Mugharasah) Agricultural partnership is a partnership in which one party presents a treeless piece of land to another to plant trees on it on the condition that they share the trees and fruits in accordance with a defined percentage. Distribution of Proceeds and Profits Distribution of proceeds and profits is a process of termination an undi vided ownership in the company by the final distribution of the assets where by rights of each partner are defined and common shares are partitioned into identified sets for each partner. This is why distribution is defined as identification of undefined shares or proceeds of a particular person.",

However, restricting the Mudarabah operations to certain commodities is circumscribed with a condition that such commodities must be commonly available so that, other things being equal, the restriction will not prevent the objectives of the Mudarabah contract from being achieved. For example, the commodities to which the Mudarabah is restricted must not be scarce, seasonal (and out of season) or in very limited supply with the consequence that the objectives of the Mudarabah contract cannot be achieved.",

    "section_title": "Appendix (B)",
    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Permissibility of Mudarabah and Its Rationale ■ Mudarabah, known also as Qirad, is a contract that arranges cooperation in business investment between capital on one hand and entrepreneurship on the other, whereby the contracting parties jointly and commonly own the realised profit as per the agreement. The party providing the capital is known Rab al-Mal and the investor is known as Mudarib or ’Amil (literally. worker) or Muqarid.(2) Mudarabah contract derives its permissibility from the following: a) From the Qur`an is the Saying of Allah, the Almighty: {“Others travelling through the land, seeking of Allah’s bounty”}.(4) This verse is interpreted to mean those who travel for the purpose of trading and seeking permissible income in order to provide for themselves and their family. b) From the Sunnah is the Hadith that says, “Al-’Abbas Ibn Abdul Muttalib used to pay money for Mudarabah and to stipulate to the Mudarib that he should not travel by sea, pass by valleys or trade in livestock, and that the Mudarib would be liable for any losses if he did so. These conditions were brought before the Prophet (peace be upon him) and he approved them”.(5) Among the Hadiths regarding the permissibility of Mudarabah is the case that states that “Umar Ibn Al-Khattab gave one man the funds belonging to an orphan for the purpose of Mudarabah and the man was trading with these funds in Iraq”.(6) c) Ibn Al-Mundhir mentioned that there is generally consensus among the scholars in respect to the permissibility of a Mudarabah contract.(7) ■ The rationale for making this contract permissible includes the following: a) Money cannot increase unless it is associated with work. It is also a) Money cannot increase unless it is associated with work. It is also not permissible to provide money in return for a periodic pre-agreed payment (rent) to a person who is willing to invest it as this will constitute a debt with Riba. b) The Mudarabah contract is made permissible to facilitate investment cooperation between capital providers who are not prepared to invest and manage their money themselves, and competent business or investment experts who lack adequate capital. In other words, there are some individuals who are rich but lack business or investment know-how and others who have business or investment expertise but lack money. This situation thus calls for the permissibility of the Mudarabah contract so as to combine the interests of the two parties. Moreover, a Mudarabah contract is an instrument that was commonly used in trade and which usage expanded in modern times to include busi ness, services, and agricultural or horticultural and industrial activities. ness, services, and agricultural or horticultural and industrial activities. a) The business philosophy of conventional banks depends on the concept a) The business philosophy of conventional banks depends on the concept of renting out money and making profit in doing so, while Shari’ah prohibits this philosophy because of its being Riba. The Mudarabah financing instrument has been an essential instrument to develop Islamic financial Institutions (Institution/Institutions). This instrument is used by these institutions to attract unrestricted or restricted investment accounts and to reinvest these funds in various activities. Contract of Mudarabah ■ The basis for the rule that both parties to a Mudarabah contract must be legally capable to appoint, or act as, an agent is because each party acts as an agent of the other party and appoints the other party to act on his behalf. The entitlement to appoint or act as an agent entitles one to conclude a Mudarabah contract. ■ The basis for regarding a Mudarabah contract initially as a non-bin ding contract is that the Mudarib is using the capital provider’s funds with his consent in a contractual relationship in which the Mudarib is just an agent, and an agency contract is not binding. ■ The basis for making a Mudarabah contract binding once the work has commenced is that a unilateral termination of the contract at this stage might frustrate the objective of the parties to make profit and might cause damage to the Mudarib since he might not receive any compen sation for his work. ■ The basis for allowing a time limit for the operation of a Mudarabah contract is that a Mudarabah contract is, in essence, an agency contract, which is subject to a designated duration.(9) The International Fiqh Academy has issued a resolution in this respect.(10) ■ The basis for considering the Mudarib as a trustee with respect to the Mudarabah funds is that the Mudarib is using another person’s money with his consent, and the Mudarib and the owner of the funds share the benefits from the use of the funds. In principle, a trustee should not be held liable for losses sustained by the funds. Rather, the risks of such losses must be borne by the Mudarabah funds. Guarantees in a Mudarabah Contract ■ The basis for allowing guarantees in a Mudarabah that would be used in case of misconduct and negligence of the Mudarib is that in such a case the Mudarib then becomes liable for losses and must bear the consequences of these actions. Requirements Relating to the Capital ■ The basis for it being permissible that the capital of Mudarabah may be constituted by the value of tangible assets contributed is that the objective of Mudarabah is to make profit. This objective can be realised whether the capital is contributed in the form of tangible assets or cash. This rule is based on the view of the Maliki and the Hanbali jurists.(12) ■ The basis for the requirement that the capital of Mudarabah should be clearly known and should be defined in terms of quality and quantity in a manner that eliminates any possibility of uncertainty or ambiguity is because recognition of profit is dependent on the recovery of the capital on the date of liquidation. However, recovery of the capital can not be ascertained if its amount was not known earlier, and this lack of knowledge may potentially lead to a dispute. ■ The basis for not allowing a debt owed by the Mudarib to the capital provider be contributed as capital in a Mudarabah contract is because, as a principle, Mudarabah capital must be (at the conclusion of a Mudarabah contract) an asset that is available and cannot be used on the spot for the Mudarabah operations. A debt fails to meet this requirement, as it is a receivable that is not available for use when the contract is concluded. Moreover, considering a debt as capital of Mudarabah involves potential Riba. This is because the creditor may be suspected of having extended the debt tenure in order to get additional consideration (for the extension) from the debtor under the name of Mudarabah. ■ The basis for the requirement that the Mudarabah operation is valid only if the capital is presented to the Mudarib is because the Mudarib is the manager of the Mudarabah operation, and the trustworthy trustee for the Mudarabah capital and income. Therefore, it is necessary that the capital be fully released to the Mudarib so that he will be able to protect and invest the capital and achieve the objective of the Mudarabah contract. Rules and Requirements Relating to Profit ■ The basis for the requirement that the profit ratio is known is because profit is the subject matter of a Mudarabah contract and a lack of knowledge as to the subject matter renders a contract void. ■ The basis for the requirement that the profit share of each party be a percentage of the profit and not a lump sum is because a Mudarabah contract is a form of partnership for sharing profit. Any condition that allocates a lump sum to one party would not be consistent with the sharing of profit. This is because the Mudarabah operation may not realise a profit other than the lump sum which goes to one party, thus excluding the other party from partnership in profit. ■ The basis for the impermissibility of simultaneously receiving a share The basis for the impermissibility of simultaneously receiving a share of profit and a fee for managing a Mudarabah is likewise that the fee is provided in the form of a lump sum and the Mudarabah operation may not realise a profit other than the lump sum, thus precluding the sharing of profit. ■ The basis for the permissibility of an agreement to change the ratio of The basis for the permissibility of an agreement to change the ratio of profit distribution at any time is that the profit is a right belonging to the parties and an agreement in the manner described does not lead to a prohibited act, such as preclusion of sharing in profit. Rather, the agreement makes the parties partners in profit.(14) ■ The basis for nullifying a Mudarabah contract when the contract is silent on the ratio of profit distribution and there is no customary practice according to which the profit is to be distributed to each party is that the subject matter of a Mudarabah contract is profit. The lack of knowledge as to the subject matter nullifies contracts. ■ The basis for nullifying a Mudarabah contract when one party sti pulates entitlement to a lump sum is because a Mudarabah is about sharing profit and this form of condition precludes sharing of profit and may potentially lead to one party being wrongfully deprived of his rights. ■ The basis for not allowing an agreement that the Mudarib be entitled to the profit earned on one of two capital funds, while the profit earned on the other capital fund belongs to the capital provider, is that such an agreement may preclude the sharing of profit and may potentially lead to one party being wrongfully deprived of his rights. ■ The basis for stating that profit is not realised unless the capital is recovered or maintained intact is the Hadith in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “The instance of a Musali (a person who performs prayer) is that of a businessperson who will not secure profit unless the capital is secured. Likewise, a supererogatory prayer is not acceptable unless the obligatory prayer is performed”.(15) This Hadith shows that distribution of profit prior to recovery of the capital, or unless the capital is maintained intact, is invalid. Moreover, profit is an addition to the capital and such an addition cannot be recognised or realised unless the capital that is the source of the profit is maintained. ■ The basis for the requirement that the Mudarib is preliminarily entit The basis for the requirement that the Mudarib is preliminarily entit led to a profit when realised, i.e. prior to distribution (an encumbrance right), and that the net profit earned will be known absolutely only after allocation through actual or constructive valuation, is analogous to the contract of sharecropping. The Mecca based Islamic Fiqh Academy has issued a resolution in support of constructive valuation.( Duties and Powers of the Mudarib ■ The basis for allowing the Mudarib freedom of action in an unrestricted Mudarabah is that the Mudarib has the aim of achieving the objective of the capital provider, which is making profit, and this is not possible unless the capital is vigorously put into operation. ■ The basis for not allowing the capital provider to stipulate a right to work with the entrepreneur (Mudarib) or to be involved in acts relating to Mudarabah operations is because such a stipulation would curtail the freedom of the Mudarib, limit the investment scope and hinder the Mudarib in achieving the objective of the Mudarabah contract, i.e. making profit. ■ The basis for not allowing the Mudarib to make a loan, gift or charitable donation from the Mudarabah fund is because these actions do not benefit the Mudarabah operation, rather, they involve potential loss to the capital provider. ■ The basis for allowing the Mudarib, when acting in the interest of the Mudarabah and in the event that the parties did not specify an amount of money for expenses, to obtain personal expenses from the Mudarabah funds as per customary practice is because what is known by custom is deemed to apply as a condition even if the parties did not clearly stipulate it. Again, the permission for the Mudarib to obtain common personal expenses in these cases is granted by custom. Liquidation of Mudarabah Contract ■ The basis for allowing liquidation of a Mudarabah contract unilate rally or by agreement of the parties or at the maturity date is because a Mudarabah contract is non-binding if the parties did not stipulate a term for its maturity. ■ The basis for allowing constructive valuation is because Shari’ah has endorsed the concept of valuation. In addition, this is allowed because it is a valid tool that passes rights to owners appropriately. The actual valuation of assets for distribution is based on a common sense because this is the principle. ■ The basis for allowing a Mudarabah contract be terminated on the grounds of loss of capital is that when the capital has been lost, the Mudarib is not able to put it to work in a business, and that the fund that was assigned for the Mudarabah is no longer in existence, thus entailing the termination of the Mudarabah contract. ■ The basis for allowing termination of a Mudarabah contract due to the death of the Mudarib is that a Mudarabah contract is similar to contract of agency or, at least, it includes agency and an agency contract is ter minable by the death of the agent.",

These include the following: ■ Transferable documentary credit: This credit entitles the benefi ciary to request the executing bank to make the credit available, partially or totally, to another beneficiary or beneficiaries. ■ Back-to-back credit, which means the credit issued is guaranteed by another credit. ■ Revolving or renewable credit, which means the beneficiary can repeatedly submit new documents for new operations within the limits of the credit amount and during its permissibility. ■ Red clause or advance payment credit whereby the bank is allowed to pay a certain percentage of the credit before submission of the documents, against an undertaking by the beneficiary to repay that amount if the goods are not shipped or the beneficiary fails to use the credit during the period of its permissibility. Such payment may be made against a letter of guarantee from the beneficiary. ■ Import and export credit (depending on the issuing bank). ■ Local and foreign credit. ■ Confirmed and non-confirmed credits. ■ Partial shipment and a non-partial shipment credit. ■ On sight or immediate payment credit, deferred payment cred it, acceptance credit and negotiable credit. ■ Syndicated credit (partnership credit), which describes the state of participation by more than one bank due to the huge amount of credit granted with each bank providing a letter of guarantee, to the extent of its participation, to the leading bank. ■ Standby credit (guarantee credit). This credit resembles letters of guarantee with a clause that payment is conditional upon beneficiary’s (in this case the contractor’s) failure to perform.",

    "section_title": "Appendix (B)",
    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Permissibility of Documentary Credit The permissibility of documentary credit is based on the principle that it relies upon contracts that are valid according to the Shari’ah, such as Kafalah (personal guarantee), Wakalah (agency contract) and Qard (loan). Kafalah (personal guarantee), Wakalah (agency contract) and Qard (loan). Shari’ah Categorization of Documentary Credit ■ The basis for the permissibility of irrevocable documentary credit is a combination of a contract of guarantee and agency. To these two the Qard (loan) transaction is to be added. It derives permissibility from the contract of mortgage (Rahn) as well, because it secures payment. The contract of guarantee creates a liability for payment, while agency determines the performance of acts relating to oper ations such as communication of the credit notification and initia tion of operations pertaining to follow-up and examination of doc ument. The loan element comes into operation when the institution pays on behalf of the client in case of documentary credit that is totally or partially uncovered.(2) ■ The basis for the permissibility of a revocable documentary credit is that it is a form of agency contract that is permitted by the Shari’ah. When a third party’s right is attached to it, it becomes binding, and this occurs when it leads to acceptance or payment. A revocable documentary credit cannot be classified under the contract of guarantee for two reasons; namely (I) it conflicts with the requirements of guarantee; and (II) an option is not permissible in guarantee contracts.(3) ■ The basis for the permissibility of the undertaking of the confirming The basis for the permissibility of the undertaking of the confirming bank and other similar undertakings of the banks that participate in issuance or confirmation of the credit is that it is an act of back up guar antee, which is permissible in the Shari’ah.(4) ■ The basis of permissibility of guarantee in irrevocable credit being qualified from the perspective of execution with the condition that documents presented conform to the conditions stipulated, is the ruling of the jurists that Kafalah (guarantee) accepts qualification through a stipulated condition.(5) ■ The basis for the ruling that documentary credit terminates with implementation or expiry is that the guarantee for documentary credit is limited in time by a period, and this is the period of validity of the credit. It is permitted to place a time frame on guarantee.(6) ■ The basis for the permissibility of the contract relied upon for doc umentary credit, as well as its conditions, is that it is a sale for which security is provided through guarantee, and this is compatible with the objectives of the contract. Contract That Precedes the Opening of Credit ■ The basis for the permissibility of making opening of documentary credit a condition in the sale contract preceding documentary credit is that such a condition is similar to a stipulation to provide a specific guarantor for payment, which is a valid condition acknowledged as an interest for the contract.(7) ■ The basis for the permissibility of undertaking international sale The basis for the permissibility of undertaking international sale contracts and their security through documentary credit is that upon examination, the international sale contracts that are secured through documentary credit pose a difficulty: Do they involve delay of the two counter-values that is prohibited by the Shari’ah? The members of the Board differed on this into those who prohibit them due to the cause indicated, and those who permit them -being in a majority with those permitting them disagreeing on the following points: a) That these contracts -prior to the ascertainment of the goods- do not involve delay in the two counter-values rather they amount to bilateral promises, which are agreements to sell and do not amount to sale itself. b) That they merely amount to extension of the session of the contract (Majlis al-’Aqd), with respect to the agreement, up to the time of ascertainment of the goods. c) That they do not amount to a delay in the two counter-values, but they are permitted on the basis of general need. d) That they are, ab initio, an exchange of a debt for a debt and this is permitted under the Shari’ah. e) That the contract preceding the opening of documentary credit amounts to a sale contingent upon the opening of credit. f) That these contracts do not involve delay in counter-values, because that is attained through a stipulation for delay, while there is no stipulation of delay in this case. Commissions and Expenses in Documentary Credit ■ The basis for the impermissibility of receiving compensation for guarantee for the aspect related to documentary credit is that a guarantee is preparatory to extending a loan, and this is not to be compensated. The four Fiqh schools are unanimous on the impermissibility of taking compensation for guarantee. This rule is endorsed by a resolution of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy,(8) a ruling of the Shari’ah Supervisory Board of the Faysal Islamic Bank of Sudan,(9) the Shari’ah Board of Al Rajhi Banking Corporation for Investment(10) and a resolution of the Shari’ah Fatwa and Supervisory Board of the Kuwait Finance House. ■ The basis for the permissibility of receiving compensation for an agency-related service in documentary credit, whether in a lump sum or as a percentage of a known amount, is that the amount is in lieu of services rendered by the institution, in its capacity as an agent of the client. The majority of the Fuqaha upheld the permissibility of charging wages for agency.(11) The Shari’ah Supervisory Board of Al Rajhi Banking Corporation for Investment has passed a resolution permitting receipt of payment including the services involved in documentary credit with out referring to the aspect of guarantee.(12) ■ The basis for the impermissibility of charging commissions in consid The basis for the impermissibility of charging commissions in consid eration for providing long or short term loans, discounting and trading (payment of the value) in documents and deferred payment bills of exchange or for providing facility, are the texts of the Qur`an and the Sunnah laying down the prohibition of Riba.(13) Guarantees in Documentary Credit ■ The basis for the permissibility of seeking guarantees explained in The basis for the permissibility of seeking guarantees explained in this Standard (item 3/4) is that collateral (Rahn) may be money, debt or tangible asset insofar as they might be lawfully owned or created according to the Shari’ah and because the debt to be secured may be a current or future obligation. ■ The basis for not allowing the Institution to sell its share of partnership, in goods purchased by the client, for a delayed payment to the client is that this amounts to a sale-buy back arrangement (Bay’ al-’Inah), which is prohibited by the Shari’ah. ■ The basis for not allowing negotiability of documents payable on sight including bills of exchange for an amount lesser than their nominal value is that this adopts the form of the sale of debt, which is prohibited.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (C) Definitions Credit Documents These are the documents relating to goods detailed in the credit. The documents are divided into two types: basic and additional documents. Basic documents include: Shipping documents, commercial invoice, ma rine insurance policy, certificate of origin, consulate invoice and prom issory note. Additional documents include: Weights certificate, analysis certificate, review and inspection certificate, warehouse receipts, delivery orders, packing review/supervision certificate, test certificate, medical certificate and non-infection certificate. Such certificates are requested to verify certain attributes and characteristics of the commodity and to make sure that it is free of defects and infection. The certificates are required by the authorities of the importing or exporting country. Bill of Lading A bill of lading is the traditional source of shipping documents. It indicates the party authorized to receive the goods, whether it is the original beneficiary, a party in whose name the bill is backed as a collateral arrangement or an agent assigned to receive the goods. A bill of lading constitutes the practical execution of the shipping contract signed between the shipper and the marine carrier. Shipping is the responsibility of either the buyer or of the seller according to the type of International Sale Contract (Commercial Terms) adopted. A bill of lading is the only shipping document that can be backed. Examination of Documents It is the process of ensuring that the documents comply with the spec ifications indicated in the letter of credit. The general conditions for the integrity of documents are detailed through the following four conditions: ■ That the documents are submitted during the validity of the credit. ■ That they are complete in number. ■ That they are complimentary and one document does not contradict another and that each contains the required information or each serves its function. ■ That they conform to the conditions of the letter of credit. In case any of these conditions is missing, for any one of these documents, it is obligatory upon the bank to reject the documents as a whole, even those that are not defective. At Sight Credit It is credit that has to be paid promptly at sight according to the value of the documents, by the issuing bank, the confirming bank or the paying bank, if the documents conform to the conditions of the credit. Deferred Payment Credit It is an undertaking given by the issuing, or confirming bank to pay at a future date, being the date fixed in the credit, the value of the documents if they conform to the conditions of the credit. It differs from acceptance credit insofar as the beneficiary does not present a promissory note with the documents. Acceptance Credit It is the acceptance of the bill of exchange attached to the documents or is signed on behalf of the bank; that is, the bank accepts the obligation of paying the nominal value on the date of maturity. Negotiation of Documents It is the payment of the value of the documents, or the purchase of the bill of exchange attached to them; that is, its discounting, whether it is to be paid at sight or after a known specified period. Acceptance of Documents ‘Under Reserve’ It occurs when the bank chooses to accept the documents at its own risk despite their non-conformance with the conditions of the credit, paying their value or accepting the bill of exchange attached to them, on the condition that it reserves the right of recourse to the beneficiary if the issuing bank does not accept the discrepancies in the documents. The paying bank usually reserves accept the discrepancies in the documents. The paying bank usually reserves this right by way of obtaining a letter of guarantee, covering the value of the documents, from the bank of the beneficiary. Marine Letter of Guarantee It is an undertaking given by the issuing bank to place the original bill of lading, when received, at the disposal of the carrier in lieu of receiving back a letter from him. The carrier in this case is relieved from all responsibility that may arise from the delivery of the goods to the importer, who gives an undertaking to the issuing bank for the acceptance of the documents regardless of any discrepancies in them. This type of letter is usually issued upon arrival of the goods when the documents are to follow or are delayed. Correspondent Bank It is the bank assigned by the issuing bank to notify the beneficiary of the credit. As a rule, the correspondent bank is under no obligation to pay the value of the credit; its role is confined to that of an intermediary. Correspondent banks are banks with which the institution makes certain arrangements for accepting or covering the value of the credits that it issues or confirms. In case the beneficiary requests notification through a non-correspondent bank, the issuing bank sends its instructions to one of its correspondent banks asking it to process the notification through the bank nominated by the beneficiary. Confirmation of Credit It is the merging of the liability of the confirming bank with the liability of the issuing bank making both banks liable for fulfilling the conditions of payment of credit, when the beneficiary presents documents that meet the terms of the credit. The beneficiary has the right to claim payment severally from either bank or jointly from both banks. The Paying Bank It is a correspondent bank of the issuing bank in the currency of the It is a correspondent bank of the issuing bank in the currency of the credit to whom the issuing bank entrusts the payment of the value of the credit on its behalf, but the paying bank is under no obligation for executing this trust. The Covering Bank Covering banks are types of correspondent banks with which the bank maintains an account and to whom it delegates the authority to cover disbursement and negotiation payments upon the first presentation. Transferable Credit It is irrevocable credit by means of which the beneficiary (first benefi ciary) requests the bank assigned, or any other licensed institution, to make ciary) requests the bank assigned, or any other licensed institution, to make payment or to undertake to pay in the future or to accept or to negotiate so as to make the credit available, in whole or in part, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries. Back to Back Credit It is irrevocable credit issued for the same purpose as that of transferable credit whenever a credit is not transferable. Revolving Credit It is credit that is opened for a fixed value and duration, except that its value is renewed automatically when it is executed or utilised so as to enable the beneficiary to present documents for a new operation within the value of the credit, during the period of its validity, and for the number of times fixed for the credit. Advance Credit or Red Clause Credit It is credit bearing a paragraph written in red ink to invite attention to its instructions. In this credit, the authorised bank is assigned to pay certain amount according to percentage of the value of the credit to the beneficiary in advance before the goods are shipped and before the documents that necessitate payment are presented. Credit Available for Negotiation This is credit by which the issuing bank grants to the correspondent bank This is credit by which the issuing bank grants to the correspondent bank the legal authority to buy bills of exchange drawn on the basis of documentary credit upon presentation of bills of exchange that are payable at sight by the issuing bank or are payable in the future to the issuer of documentary credit. Accordingly, the seller is able to receive the value of the credit (bills of exchange) upon presentation of required complete documents that obligate payment of the value of the credit.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Permissibility of Ju’alah Ju’alah contract is permissible according to the majority of the Fuqaha on the basis of the Qur`an, the Sunnah, Ijma’ (consensus of Fuqaha) and Ijtihad (reasoning). • As for the Qur`an, the evidence is in the story of Yusuf (Joseph) and his brother after the announcement of the loss of the King’s great beaker, {“For him who brings it is the (reward of) a camel load; I will stand surety for it”}.(2) • As for the Sunnah, the evidence is in the report from Abu Sa’id Al-Khu dri(3) about the stipulation of Ju’l (compensation) if the chief of the tribe was cured through him and the tacit approval of the Prophet (peace be upon him) of this. • There is Ijma’ (consensus of Fuqaha) about the contract of Ju’alah in es sence with some disagreement about its scope insofar as some Fuqaha restricted it to reward for the return of a runaway slave, as is recorded in the Sunnah. • As for Ijtihad (reasoning), there is a general need for Ju’alah in the case of acts that cannot be performed by a person himself nor can he find someone who will volunteer for him. Further, it is suitable for cases for which the contract of Ijarah is not suitable, like the return of lost prop erty from an unknown location. Shari’ah Status of Ju’alah • The basis for the principle that Ju’alah is not binding for the offeror is that accrual of the compensation is contingent upon a condition, thus, it resembles bequest, which is not binding. The basis for Ju’alah being non-binding for the worker is that the work to be done is uncertain, thus, it resembles Mudarabah, which is not binding. • The basis for regarding Ju’alah as binding when the worker has commenced work is that at this stage Ju’alah is similar to Mudarabah in which the Mudarib has commenced work. Like Mudarabah, Ju’alah is considered binding by the Maliki scholars in such a case. The basis for considering it binding when the two parties undertake not to terminate the contract during the period of the contract is that unilateral revocation leads to the loss of the effort put in by the worker or the likelihood of injury for the offeror. • The basis for the entitlement of the worker to receive reasonable wages, when the contract is revoked after commencement of work, is that the work done by the worker is legally valid and loss is not to be caused to him. He, therefore, has recourse to reasonable compensation as is the case in Ijarah when it is revoked due to a defect. Elements of Ju’alah and Its Conditions • The basis for the rule that it is obligatory in Ju’alah that all its elements (two parties, form, work and compensation) be found is that it is a contract and must have these elements. Further, Ju’alah is a commutative contract that must have a form to indicate the task required as well as the amount of compensation. • The basis for permitting the worker to seek assistance from others, when there is no stipulation for his personal services, is that Ju’alah is similar to agency in which seeking help from others is valid. • The basis for not stipulating the identification of the worker and directing the offer towards the general public is that the offeror does not know of a person who is able to achieve what is required. • The basis for not stipulating acceptance on the part of the worker, when he is unknown, is that it is not possible to obtain his acceptance. • The basis for allowing the work to be uncertain is the general need along The basis for allowing the work to be uncertain is the general need along with the impossibility of determining the extent of work. • The basis for stipulating that compensation be known is that compen sation is like wages and that there is no need to validate Ju’alah when the compensation is unknown as against the uncertainty about the work and the worker. • The basis for recourse to reasonable compensation upon the vitiation of the named compensation is analogy constructed upon Ijarah with recourse to reasonable wages upon the vitiation of the named wages. • The basis for the permissibility of compensation being a portion of the subject-matter of Ju’alah, even though it is uncertain and does not ex ist, is that it is a type of uncertainty that does not prevent delivery and involves no Gharar (uncertainty) since entitlement to compensation is not established until the task is accomplished. • The basis for the rule that entitlement to compensation is not established The basis for the rule that entitlement to compensation is not established until the work is completed and delivered, is that work in Ju’alah is not determined or certain, therefore, stipulating payment as compensation would amount to compensating something that has not compensation because the work has not been completed. Applications of Ju’alah • The basis for permitting an institution to undertake Ju’alah, as a worker or as an offeror, is the permissibility of Ju’alah for which natural persons and juristic persons have the same legal capacity. • The basis for the permissibility of Ju’alah for debt collection, and other The basis for the permissibility of Ju’alah for debt collection, and other similar acts stated in the standard, is that these are acts whose precise determination is difficult and Ijarah is not suitable for them, while Ju’alah is legally valid despite the uncertainty with respect to work.",

    "section_title": "Appendix (B)",
    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Dealings in Commercial Papers ■ The basis for the permissibility of dealing in a bill of exchange is that it is in the meaning of Hawalah or Qard (loan) contract, which are agreed upon by Ijma’ (consensus of Fuqaha), or in the mea ning of Suftajah (demand note), which is valid according to the preponderant opinion. The evidence for this is the report from a number of Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) who dealt in these instruments. It is reported from Abdullah Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he used to take silver from tra ders at Mecca and write down a demand note for them to be paid at Kufa. It is related from Abdullah Ibn Al-Zubayr that he used to take dirhams from traders at Mecca and then write a note drawn upon his brother Mus’ab in Iraq. When Ibn Abbas was asked about this, he saw no harm in the transaction.(3) Al-Muwaffaq Ibn Qudamah,(4) may Allah confer mercy upon him, has related from Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) that he was asked about a similar transaction and he saw no harm in it. Further, in the Suftajah is the interest of both the lender and the borrower without harm being caused to either one of them. The lender is secure against the danger of the highway in trans porting his dirhams to the destined town, while the borrower benefits from the loan and is also secure against the dangers of the highway being under an obligation to pay in the said town. The Shari’ah does not lay down a prohibition for interests that do no invoke harm. ■ Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah(5) (may Allah confer mercy upon him) has said: “The correct view is that of permissibility, because both the lender and the borrower benefit from such raising of a loan, and the Shari’ah does not proscribe what benefits them and is in their interest; it proscribes what is harmful for them.” In addition to this, there is no text that prohibits a Suftajah nor is such meaning implied by the texts. It is, therefore, necessary to maintain its permissibility, especially when there is a general need for it.(6) ■ The basis for the permissibility of a promissory note is that it is considered a document acknowledging a debt, and Allah, the Al Mighty, has commanded the securing of debts, as He, the Al-Mighty, says: {“O you who believe! When you contract a debt for a fixed period, write it down. Let a scribe write it down in justice between you...”}(7) ■ The permissibility of a cheque drawn by the client upon a bank, with which he has a balance is that it is in the nature of Hawalah. The Muhil (transferor) is the accountholder, the Muhal is the beneficiary and the Muhal Alayh (transferee) is the drawee bank. ■ The permissibility of a cheque drawn by the client upon a bank with which he does not have a balance is that it is Hawalah. This view is held by those who do not stipulate for the permissibility of Hawalah that the transferee be indebted to the Muhal (transferor) with Hawalah (transfer) being valid for a person who does not owe a prior debt. Some jurists call this absolute Hawalah or Hawalah upon one with no liability. The second view is that it is an agency for borrowing, and both are (independently) valid. This rule, however, is contingent upon the cheque no invoking Riba by way of an overdraft, for banks usually do not lend without interest. Banks will not accept cheques drawn upon them by clients with no balance except by charging Riba-bearing profits that are due from the client along with the value of the cheque. Consequently, if the cheque drawn by the client upon the bank, where he does not have a balance, includes Riba-bearing profits it is prohibited; it is not permissible to write such a cheque nor to undertake transactions in it. ■ The basis for the permissibility of dealing in crossed and account payee The basis for the permissibility of dealing in crossed and account payee cheques, and the obligation of the payee bank to abide by the conditions stipulated by the accountholder for the two types of cheque, is the generality of the Hadith stating: “Muslims abide by the conditions they stipulate”.(8) The reason is that such a condition promotes the inherent interest of the contract. Further, the primary principle for conditions and contracts is that of permissibility. Endorsement The basis for the permissibility of endorsement is that it does not go The basis for the permissibility of endorsement is that it does not go beyond the meaning of either Hawalah (transfer) or Wakalah (agency), and beyond the meaning of either Hawalah (transfer) or Wakalah (agency), and both are permissible. Discounting of Commercial Papers ■ The basis for not permitting discounting of commercial paper is that in reality the discounting of commercial paper amounts to a loan with interest. What affirms this is that the interest charged through discounting varies according to the value of the commercial paper and its date of maturity, and loan with interest is prohibited by agreement. ■ The permissibility of paying less than the value of the paper, when the transaction is between the holder and the first beneficiary, is that it belongs to the category of the issue known as “negotiating a deferred debt for part of it paid promptly.” This is what is known as Da’ Wa Ta’ajjal (reduce the amount for hastening payment), and according to one opinion it is permissible to undertake such a transaction. The evidence that supports permissibility is the Hadith of Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), stating: “When the Prophet (peace be upon him) decided to expell Banu Al-Nadir, they said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, you have ordered our expulsion when we have against people debt claims that are not yet due.’ The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, ‘Reduce the amounts to hasten payments’.”(9) Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), was asked about the issue of a person who has a deferred claim against another, and he says to the debtor, “Hasten the payment and I will reduce the amount for you”, so Ibn Abbas responded saying, “There is no harm in it”. Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), was the narrator of the previous Hadith. Further, this issue is the opposite of the issue of Riba. That is, Riba involves an excess in both the period and the amount, which is entirely harmful for the debtor, whereas this issue involves the absolving of the liability of the debtor with respect to the debt with a benefit coming to the creditor through prompt payment. Each one of them benefits without being subjected to harm. This is different from Riba, the prohibition of which is agreed upon and that causes injury to the debtor. The benefit in Riba is exclusively for the creditor (owner of capital). Thus, this case differs from Riba in both form and meaning. The reason is that the excess in Riba as a counter-value for the period leads to a grave hardship, for a single dirham is doubled and multiplied keeping the Dhimmah (liability) engaged without any corresponding benefit. the Dhimmah (liability) engaged without any corresponding benefit. In the case of reduction of the amount and hastening of payment, the liability of the debtor is removed and the prompt payment benefits the creditor. The Law-giver encourages the discharging of debt liabilities. The debtor has been called a person imprisoned by difficulties, and thus in the discharging his liability is a release from these shackles. This is different from his remaining patiently burdened with an excess. ■ The basis for treating commercial paper as a price for ascertained goods The basis for treating commercial paper as a price for ascertained goods is that it amounts to the sale of a debt, to a person other than the one who owes it, for ascertained goods. This is permitted according to the Maliki school if it takes place after possession so that it does not turn into the delaying of the two counter-values. A resolution pertaining to this has been issued by the Islamic Fiqh Academy of the Organization of Islamic Conference.(11) Taking Possession of Commercial Papers ■ The basis for considering a cheque, whether certified or one of the same type, as possession of the amount mentioned in it, is that a cheque is secured by a large number of guarantees that make the possessor the owner of its contents. The beneficiary in this case is able to undertake transactions in it by selling, buying or by making a gift. Further, there is a strong protection provided by state governments to support confidence in cheques. In addition to this, relying upon a cheque means the existence of sufficient funds to cover its amount with the certifier undertaking to retain the funds until the end of the period fixed for payment. It is for this reason that people in general prefer certified cheques over cash for large transactions. ■ The basis for not considering an uncertified cheque, or one that is similar to it as far as the possession of its amount is concerned, is the probability that there is no balance to cover it or there is an insufficient balance. The basis for possession is customary practice, and a resolution has been passed by the Islamic Fiqh Academy deeming the receipt of a certified cheque as possession. ■ The basis for the permissibility of dealing in cheques for bank transfers, The basis for the permissibility of dealing in cheques for bank transfers, when the intention is to transfer the same currency in which payment is to be made, is that it belongs to the category of Suftajah, which is permissible according to one out of two opinions of the jurists. Payment Guarantees for the Value of Commercial Paper ■ The basis for considering a guarantee for acceptance as an undertaking and an obligation on the part of the drawee to pay to the legal holder, on the date of maturity, the amount of debt stated on the bill of exchange, is that this undertaking and obligation is to be fulfilled according to the Shari’ah. This requirement is due to the generality of the words of Allah, the Exalted, saying: {“O you who believe! Fulfil (your) obligations”},(12) as well as due to the generality of the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Muslims abide by the conditions they stipulate”.(13) ■ The conditions a person stipulates for himself, and by which he is bound, are included in this meaning. There is also the Hadith of Jabir Ibn Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) did not pray over (the funeral of) a person who died while owing a debt. A dead person was brought to him (for prayers) and he said, ‘Does he owe a debt?’ The people replied, ‘Yes, he owes two dinars.’ At this Abu Qatadah Al-Ansari said, ‘The two dinars are on me, O Messenger of Allah.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) then offered the funeral prayers for him”.(14) In this Hadith, we notice that Abu Qatadah Al-Ansari (may Allah be In this Hadith, we notice that Abu Qatadah Al-Ansari (may Allah be pleased with him) offers an undertaking and accepts the obligation to pay the debt owed by the deceased, and this is accepted by the Prophet (peace be upon him). In fact, this undertaking and obligation given by Abu Qatadah were deemed sufficient to absolve the deceased from all liability for the debt. In some different texts of the Hadith, it has been reported that after the statement of Abu Qatadah (The two dinars are on me), “The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, ‘The right of the creditor is due and the deceased is absolved of it.’ Abu Qatadah responded in the affirmative, so the Prophet (peace be upon him) prayed over him”.’(15) The removal of all liability for the debt from the deceased was due to the undertaking and obligation given by Abu Qatadah (may Allah be pleased with him), to pay the debt due form this person and because of which he became indebted to the extent of two dinars. Al-Muwaffaq Ibn Qudamah (may Allah confer mercy upon him) said: “The words of the Prophet (peace be upon him): ‘The deceased is absolved of it’ mean that ‘you have now become subject to the claim for two dinars.’ This is by way of emphasis for establishing the claim against him as well as the obligation to pay”.(16) ■ The basis for permitting the holder of commercial paper to have recourse to all persons who have signed the paper is that by doing so they bind themselves to the extent of the value of the paper in case of non-payment. The Ulama arrived at a consensus on the permissibility of guarantees on the whole. ■ The basis for the permissibility of guarantees through tangible assets is that these are treated as Rahn (mortgage) and are governed by the same rules that apply to Rahn. The Ulema arrived at a consensus for the permissibility of Rahn (Mortgage).",

    "section_title": "Appendix (B)",
    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Realisation of Possession in the Shari’ah ■ The basis for the realisation of actual possession with respect to gold, silver and currencies through actual physical possession is the sound tradition reported from Ubadah Ibn Al-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), said, “Gold for gold, silver for silver. . . ,” till he said, “like for like, equal for equal, from hand to hand. If these species differ, then sell as you like as long as it is from hand to hand”.(2) ■ The basis for acknowledging custom (’Urf) as the basis for the realisation of possession is the consensus (Ijma’) of the Jurists (Fuqaha).It is in this regard that Al-Khatib Al-Shirbini says: “The reason is that the Law giver has used the term possession in an unqualified sense and has deemed it the basis of rules. He did not elaborate it, and there is no definition for it in the language. It is for this reason that recourse is to be had to custom (’Urf)”.(3) Ibn Taymiyyah said, “As long as there is no definition for it in the language or in the Shari’ah, recourse must be had to the custom of the people, like possession mentioned in the words of the Prophet (peace be upon him): ‘He who buys food is not to sell it until he takes possession of it’.”(4) Al-Khattabi says: “Forms of possession differ for things in accordance with a difference in their own forms and in accordance with the varying practices of the people with respect to them.”(5) ■ The basis for the realisation of possession in immoveable property through relinquishment is customary practice. The opinion of the majority of the jurists among the Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi’is, Hanba lis and Zahiris, as well as others besides them, is that possession in immoveable property is delivered through relinquishment and the facilitating of transactions in it.(6) Hanafi jurists have stipulated that if a lock is placed on the immoveable property, then, it is sufficient for the delivery of possession to deliver the key along with relinquish ment so as to provide the facility to the possessor to open it without difficulty.(7) ■ The basis for considering registration of immoveable property as construc tive possession in the case of mortgage (Rahn) is custom and its practice (in countries that have adopted the system of registration of property) whereby registration of mortgage of immovable property by entry in a page of the register of mortgages is deemed delivery of possession un a page of the register of mortgages is deemed delivery of possession un der the law (constructive possession) and it acts as a substitute for actual delivery of possession with respect to its legal effects and results. This applies even if the property has in it the household assets of the tenant or is attached to the rights of the lessor over this property, because in such a case too they are considered possession constructively and in fact.(8) ■ Add to this the fact that official mortgage grants to the creditor (mortgagee) a personal right over the mortgaged property, which gives him, as a result of the death of the owner or his insolvency, a right prior to all the credi tors for the satisfaction of his claim from this property.(9) Possession of Ascertained Moveable Property ■ The basis for the realisation of possession in ascertained moveable proper ty, as well as liabilities by description, through relinquishment in favour of one entitled to it and in a manner that enables him to deliver it without any restriction, whether or not the moveable property needs to be delivered through one of the customary units of measure, is that delivery of a thing literally means delivering it completely without any impediments, so that no one shares it with the possessor, and this is possible by relinquishment. Further, the person who is under an obligation to deliver must have a way through which he can be discharged of his obligation, and what is in his ability is to relinquish it and remove all obstacles. As for actual physical possession (by hand), it is not within his ability to provide that for it is a voluntary act of taking possession. If the obligation to make such a delivery is imposed on him, it would become difficult for him to meet such an obligation.(10)This rule, as well as its basis, has been supported by a resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Academy (OIC).(11) ■ The basis for considering the registration of pledges (hypothecation) of mobile moveable property like cars, steamers, airplanes and trains in the official register for the beneficiary (in countries where a system of registration has been adopted for such moveable property) is deemed constructive possession for what it represents. It is the governing custom that considers official registration as the delivery of constructive posses sion to the beneficiary and acts as a substitute for actual possession with respect to its legal effects and consequences. ■ The basis for stipulating the ascertainment (setting aside) of moveable property through customary units of measure for the realisation of pos session are the words of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “He who buys food (wheat) is not to sell it until he has measured it.”(12) insofar as they indicate that possession in this case is not attained except by the use of the cubic measure. Thus, ascertainment in what is estimated by cubic measure is through cubic measure and the remaining types are assigned a similar rule on the basis of analogy.(13) This is the view of the majority of the Jurists from among the Malikis, Shafi`is and Hanbalis upholding that possession in things that are estimated by cubic measure, weight, linear measure and counting is attained by taking delivery through these measures accompanied by relinquishment. ■ The basis for considering the delivery of documents pertaining to commodities, appliances and goods (like bills of lading and warehouse receipts) as constituting constructive possession of what they represent is the customary practice in this respect seeking support from the view of the Malikis that the mode of possession in moveable property that is not subjected to estimation is recourse to custom (’Urf).(14) Further, the basis for stipulating cubic measure for the soundness of possession in basis for stipulating cubic measure for the soundness of possession in food that is estimated by cubic measure in the tradition from the Prophet (peace be upon him) is the custom that was prevalent during the period of the Prophet (peace be upon him) to the effect that possession in things subjected to cubic measure is through cubic measure and for the rest analogy is to be employed. As the determination of the issue of possession in contracts is based on custom, therefore, everything that is taken by custom to be possession in a certain period is to be deemed as possession from the perspective of the Shari’ah. If the custom of the people changes in this respect, the consideration of that mode as possession ceases. The reason is that where the constructive basis of rules is custom, the rules will alter with a change in custom,(15) except for those things that have been specified by the Shari’ah. As far as the custom prevalent in have been specified by the Shari’ah. As far as the custom prevalent in our times is based upon the consideration of the delivery of documents for moveable commodities and goods -even where these are subjected to estimation- as amounting to possession of these commodities and goods, it will be deemed valid from the perspective of the Shari’ah. The basic principle here is what is stated by Al-Wansharisi, “A thing that is acted upon by the people and is preferred by their custom and practice must be accommodated through the Shari’ah even against disagreement and opposition, as far as possible”.(16) ■ The basis for considering prior possession of a certain thing as a substitute The basis for considering prior possession of a certain thing as a substitute for subsequent possession on grounds that are acknowledged by the Shari’ah, when it represents it, is that the purpose behind the realisation of possession is to establish control over, and the ability to undertake transactions in, the thing possessed. If this state is found possession is found too. This is based on what is upheld by the Malikis and Hanbalis to the effect that if a person sells a thing, or gives it away as gift or pledges it, while the thing is in the possession of a usurper, borrower, bailee, hirer, agent or another, then prior possession represents absolutely subsequent entitled possession through the contract, irrespective of the nature of possession exercised by the possessor being that of liability or trust and irrespective of the entitled possession being in the nature of trust or liability. As for what arises from this with respect to the possessor being liable for the thing possessed or holding it as a trustee, it has no connection with or effect upon the reality of possession.(17) Expenses of Possession ■ The basis for the view that the expenses of possession of the sold commo dity are borne by the seller is that the delivery of the sold commodity is obligatory on the seller by virtue of the contract, and the contract is not completed without it; and a thing without which an obligation cannot be fulfilled is also obligatory. Accordingly, this is what was upheld by the ma jority of the Jurists to the effect that meeting the expenses of the delivery of the sold commodity -by presenting it if it is absent and by ascertaining it if it needs to be ascertained by a customary unit of measure- is the responsi bility of the seller. The basis for the view that expenses, if any, of taking delivery of the price are the responsibility of the buyer, is that payment of the price to the seller is obligatory upon the buyer, thus, it is binding on him to bear the burden of all that is required by such delivery. The basis for qualifying this rule to impose the expenses on both parties insofar as there is no condition to the contrary, is extended from the ruling of the majority of the Jurists of upholding conditions. As for the qualification that “there is no custom to the contrary,” it is based on the view of the Jurists, insofar as it is stated in their texts that if there is a stipulation or custom to the contrary, then, it is binding to follow such stipulation or custom.(18) ■ The basis for the buyer bearing the expenses of constructive possession of what he has purchased, as represented by official registration and attestation for the sale of immoveable property or its mortgage in countries that have adopted a system of registration of transfer of immoveable property, as well as the sale of some mobile moveable property like cars, vehicles, steamers and airplanes or their pledging (hypothecation) in countries that have adopted a system of officially registering such things, and as well as the purchase of shares of corporations -whose trading is permissible according to the Shari’ah in markets for financial paper- is the customary practice in all these things. Further, such a practice secures the interest of the buyer and is supported by the rule that gain is linked to the bearing of expenses. It is also supported by derivation of the rule from what has been stated by the Hanafi Jurists to the effect that the expenses of the drafting of documents, promissory notes and of witnessing, which confirm the transaction of sale, are to be borne by the buyer as long as there is no custom or stipulation to the contrary. ■ The basis for the seller bearing the expenses for the delivery of the sold commodity to the buyer with the stipulation of a known place (other than the place of contract where it is present) is what has been stated by the Hanafis and the Hanabalis affirming that such expenses are borne by the seller in case of a stipulation to this effect.(19) Expenses of Possession in Qard (Loan) ■ The basis for the borrower bearing the expenses of delivery and acquisition, which refer to taking of delivery through customary units of measure in a contract of Qard, is that the lender has undertaken a good act, and costs are not to be imposed on one who does a good act.(20) Linked to these with respect to the rule are the expenses of the drawing up of documents, promissory notes and so on, which are matters that are needed for the implementation, execution or verification of the contract of Qard (loan), it is the borrower who bears these costs insofar as these are the requirements or appendages of raising a loan, which is for his interest. The lender is undertaking an act of donation of the benefits of his wealth and the person doing good is not to be made to bear costs over and above his granting of a thing, because “No ground (of complaint) can there be against those who do good.”(21) If it is made binding on him to bear the costs of lending and recovery as well as attestation, it would run counter to his good act, and it would lead to the preventing to those who own wealth from lending it. Expenses of Possession in Deposit (Bailment) ■ The basis for the depositor bearing the costs of deposit and recovery in a contract of Ida’ (deposit) is that “The burden of possession on each thing is binding upon the one who benefits from its possession, due to the principle: Gains are based on the bearing of costs.”(22)22 It is known that the benefit in deposit and its return belong to the depositor alone, thus, the expenses that are incurred on its deposit and recovery are bin ding upon him.(23) Key Modern Applications of Possession ■ The basis for considering the possession of a bank draft or a personal cheque, accepted for payment by the drawee, as constructive possession of the amount accepted is customary banking practice and trading transac tions in this respect. The confirmation of this is laid down in a resolution of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy.(24) ■ The basis for considering a payment on a credit card as constructive possession of the amount of repayment is banking practice in this respect. Likewise, in the consideration of a deposit by a person of an amount in a bank account of the client, irrespective of this being cash, a bank endorsement, or a cheque accepted for payment by the drawee bank, as constructive possession by the beneficiary. This has been confirmed by a resolution of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (C) Definitions Al-’Aqar (Immoveable Property) It is something that has a permanently affixed foundation and it is not possible to transfer it or move it, along with the subsistence of its shape and form, like land and houses. Al-Manqul (Moveable Property) It is something that can be transferred and moved. Thus, it includes cash, loans, animals, cars, ships, airplanes, trains, things subjected to cubic measure or weight. Bay’ Al-Juzaf (Sale by Random Estimate) It is the sale of something whose precise quantity is not known, and its quantity is known through estimation without employing a cubic measure, weight, linear measure, count. Al-Qabd Bi-Sifat Al-Daman (Possession Creating a Liability for Return) It is the acquisition of a thing that leads to the liability for the return of the thing, if it is a fungible commodity, that is, its return to its owner as long as the thing exists, and its value, if it is non-fungible, on its loss or conversion, whatever the cause of this, and this when it occurs without the permission of the owner (as a wrongful act, delict, tort), like the possession by a thief or usurper, or with the permission of the owner, but with the intention of owning it, like the possession of one bargaining for it or one who has expressed the intention to own it. Some Jurists have deemed the possession by the borrower, the mortgagee (pledge), lessor and the independent contractor to be of this nature. Al-Qabd Bi-Sifat Al-Amanah (Possession Creating a Trust) It is the acquisition of a thing that leads to its treatment as a trust in the possession of the possessor insofar as he does not bear the liability of its loss, and as long as he has not committed a tort or negligence in its safe keeping. This occurs with the permission of the owner when there is no intention to own it rather it is for the interest of the owner, like the bailee, agent, dedicated servant, Wali and Wasi, or it is for the interest of the person acquiring it, like the tenant, borrower, and mortgagee, or for their common interest, like the Mudarib, partner, tenant and irrigator. ’Urf (Custom) It is what is practised by the people and what they have come to follow in terms of words, acts or relinquishment. The ’Urf that is acknowledged by the Shari’ah is the one that meets the following conditions: 1. That it should not contradict the Shari’ah. If the ’Urf goes against a Shar’iah Text or one of the principles of the Shari’ah, it is a custom that is void. 2. That the ’Urf should be continuous or predominantly so. 3. That the ’Urf be prevalent at the time of the undertaking of the transaction. 4. That the two parties to the contract should not have expressly stip ulated against it. If they express such a stipulation the ’Urf is not admissible.",

It is for this reason that the rule is similar to that for gift (Hibah) in which ownership is transferred with the taking of possession. ■ The basis for the rule that the subject-matter of Qard be a fungible item is that it is only such an item that can be returned by the borrower. Further, fungible items are compensated through similar substitutes in usurpa tion and destruction. ■ The basis for the obligation of returning the counter-value of Qard at the same place where it was granted, when there is no contrary stipulation, is that this is the governing rule. Stipulation of an Excess in the Counter-Value of Qard ■ The basis for the prohibition of stipulating an excess in the counter-value of Qard for the lender are evidences from the Qur`an, the Sunnah, consensus of Fuqaha (Ijma’) as well as rational arguments that convey the prohibition of Riba (usury) in Qard. Stipulation of Repayment in a Land (Place) Other Than That of Qard ■ The basis for the permissibility of repayment in a land other than that The basis for the permissibility of repayment in a land other than that where Qard was granted so as to provide a facility to the borrower whether or not the lender benefits from this, is as follows: 1. The reports from the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, which indicate the permissibility of stipulating repayment in a land other than that where Qard was made. This is a view upheld by the Malikis and the Hanbalis and it was preferred by Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Al-Qayyim Al-Jawziyyah. 2. The stipulation of repayment in a land other than that of the Qard is in the interest of both the lender and the borrower without cau sing injury to either along with the existence of a need. The Shari’ah does not lay down the prohibition of interests that bear no injury. In fact it lays down their permissibility. It does prohibit those that are injurious, but here the benefit is mutual and they are cooperating to arrange this. It, therefore, belongs to the category of cooperation and participation. 3. The basic rule in transactions (Mu’amalat) is permissibility, and the stipulation of repayment of a loan in a land other than that of the Qard is not expressly prohibited by the texts, nor is the meaning expressly stated in the texts so that prohibition could be extended through analogy. Thus, the repayment falls under the rule of permis sibility. Stipulation of a Period in Qard ■ The basis for the permissibility of stipulating a period in Qard, for Qard can be delayed by stipulating a period, are evidences about the permissibility of a period of delay, the obligation of abiding by conditions and contracts, for the realisation of the purposes of the Qard, and for repelling injury. Stipulating a Contract of Sale within the Contract of Qard ■ The bases for the prohibition of stipulating a contract of sale within the contract of Qard are the following: 1. The saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “A Salaf (loan) and sale (in one contract) are not permitted nor are two conditions in a sale nor the profit from a thing for which the liability for loss is not borne nor the sale of what you do not have”. 2. The underlying reasoning is that the word Salaf in the words of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “A Salaf (loan) and sale (in one contract) are not permitted”, means Qard. The Hadith indi cates the impermissibility of combining a Qard and a sale in a single contract. The generality of its meaning includes the imper missibility of stipulating a contract of sale in a contract of Qard as well as the impermissibility of stipulating a Qard contract within a contract of sale. 3. The stipulation of a contract of sale within a contract of Qard is a means towards obtaining an excess in Qard as he may oblige him with respect to the price for the sake of Qard, and in this way the Qard will be created with a stipulated excess, which is Riba. These are means that, by agreement, are to be prevented and blocked. 4. The stipulation of a contract of sale within a contract of Qard removes the contract of Qard from its main purpose, which is to provide a facility. The reason is that Qard is not a commutative contract, it is rather a contract of piety and virtue; thus, it is not valid if compen sation is stipulated in it. If Qard is linked to a commutative contract, it will receive a part in the compensation and this will take it out of its required purpose. This will nullify it and nullify the commutative contract linked to it as well. ■ The basis for the prohibition of a stipulation by the lender that the borrower gives him a gift is that in reality this amounts to Qard with an excess that is stipulated for the benefit of the lender and this excess is the gift. Thus, it amounts to prohibited Riba and removes the contract from the category of a compassionate contract moving it to one of Riba. Further, this stipulation generates a benefit for the lender and the Jurists have unanimously agreed that any contract that yields a benefit stipulated for the lender is imper missible. The benefit in this stipulation is that the lender will benefit from a second loan from the borrower, and this benefit is not in lieu of anything other than the very Qard that he gave him. Stipulation of a Reward for Raising Loans on the Basis of Credit Worthiness ■ The basis for permitting the stipulation of a reward for raising loans on the basis of credit status is that this is a counter-value for a service rende red, and this is what is upheld by the Jurists that a reward may be acquired for recommendations and lending of status. Charges for Services Actually Rendered ■ The basis for the permissibility of the lender charging only what is equivalent The basis for the permissibility of the lender charging only what is equivalent to the actual costs incurred is that these are in lieu of the costs alone. The lender is doing a favour and the person doing a favour is not to be penalised. The basis for the prohibition of charging in excess of this is that in such a case it would amount to an excess in lieu of the Qard. Resolution No. 13 (1/3) was issued by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy (OIC) regarding the recovery of actual costs. Material Benefits at the Time of Repayment That Are Not Stipulated ■ The basis for the permissibility of giving an excess, in terms of quantity The basis for the permissibility of giving an excess, in terms of quantity or quality, at the time of repayment by way of generosity and goodwill, when these are neither stipulated nor is there a practice of paying them, is the Hadith reported from Abu Rafi’, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) borrowed a very young camel from a man and then wished to present to him one of the camels of the Sadaqah (Zakat), so he asked Abu Rafi` to repay the man his camel. Abu Rafi’ returned it to him and said, “I do not find anything there ex cept a full grown four year old camel.” The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Give him this camel. The best people are those who do better in of repayment”.(4) It is reported from Abu Hurayrah that a man came to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) seeking alms. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) borrowed food amounting to one-half of a Wasq and gave the man this. When the lender came demanding his loan, he gave him a full Wasq saying, “One-half of this is your repayment and the other half is a present from me”.(5) Material Benefits Not Stipulated Prior to Repayment ■ The basis for the prohibition of material benefits not stipulated prior to repayment, unless these benefits are not for the sake of Qard or in lieu thereof, are the following: 1. From Anas Ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, `When one of you grants a Qard and a gift is made to him by the borrower or he offers him a free ride on his animal, he is not to accept this from him, unless such a practice was prevalent among them prior to the Qard’.”(6) 2. Reports of precedents laid down by the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, which indicate the prohibition of accepting the gift of the borrower and other types of benefits, unless there is an evidence that this is not for the sake of the loan, and that the lender responds with a similar gift or adjusts it as repayment of the debt. Current Accounts ■ The basis for the determination that current accounts constitute loans (Qurud), are the following: 1. That the bank comes to own the deposits in the current accounts and has the right to undertake transactions in the amounts and to seek growth in them (through investment). Further, it is under an obligation to return a similar amount on demand. This is the very meaning of Qard, which is the giving of wealth to one who benefits from it -that is, employs it and consumes it in pursuit of his aims- and then returns its counter value. This differs from Wadi’ah (deposit) in the terminology of Fiqh, which is wealth deposited with a person for safe-custody so that he does not employ the wealth and returns this very wealth to the owner. 2. It is binding on the bank to return a similar amount on demand for the current deposit, and it guarantees such return even upon loss of the wealth, whether or not it was negligent. This is the purpose of the contract of Qard, as against Wadi’ah in Fiqh terminology insofar as the Wadi’ah is a trust in the possession of the custodian, thus, if it is destroyed due to his transgression or negligence, he is held liable for it, but if it is destroyed without such transgression or negligence, he is not liable. Resolution No. 86 (3/9) was issued by the International Is lamic Fiqh Academy (OIC) regarding the status of current accounts. ■ The basis for the permissibility of the bank demanding service charges The basis for the permissibility of the bank demanding service charges -for maintaining current accounts- for the services rendered, is an excess over the duty owed by it, because it is entitled to such charges in lieu of the acts undertaken by it and services rendered to the client. ■ The basis for the permissibility of the owner of a current account utilising The basis for the permissibility of the owner of a current account utilising a chequebook and ATM card without compensation are the following: 1. The additional benefit arising out of this issue is common for both parties -the lender and the borrower- as both benefit from it, thus, both benefits are set off against each other. In fact, the benefit that goes to the client through the issuance of a chequebook and an ATM card is secondary and is not a primary benefit insofar as the bank has set up this system for serving its own numerous aims and objectives, thus, the benefit accruing to the bank from this system is a primary benefit, while the realisation of the benefit for the client from this system is a consequence of the employment of this system by the bank for its aims and objectives. 2. The benefit derived by the owner of a current account -the lender- from this system without a counter-value is not a benefit separate from the Qard. In fact, it is a means for the satisfaction of the loans acquired by the bank insofar as these are ways for the repayment of loans for every lender as when he demands them. ■ The basis for the prohibition of presents and gifts, when the underlying The basis for the prohibition of presents and gifts, when the underlying cause is Qard, insofar as the bank gives these presents and gifts to one who gives it a Qard, is that these are by way of gifts to the lender prior to the satisfaction of the loan when these are due to the Qard.(7)As for the basis of presents and gifts in general, they are not related to Qard and there is no suspicion about them. Overdrafts between the Institutions and Their Correspondents ■ The basis for the permissibility of overdrafts between institutions and their correspondents is general need and that the benefit derived from this practice is not specific to the lender alone. In fact, the benefit is mu tual. Further, it does not fall under the category of Qard rather it is a step for transacting with one who deals with you. Thus, the issue does not resemble the case of “You give me a loan and I will give you a loan.”",

Further, there is opposition to the conditions required by the contract. The basis for the conditions of spot contracts in the commodity markets is that these are general conditions of sale and are permitted according to the Shari’ah. ■ The basis for the permissibility of contracts in which one of the counter values is deferred is the validity of Bay’ Mu’ajjal and Salam. ■ The basis for the permissibility of forms of transactions mentioned in the Standard related to international commodity sales is that they are concluded in accordance with the principles of Wakalah (agency), sale with a deferred period, Murabahah sale, and all these are valid contracts. ■ The basis for the obligation of issuing an offer by the agent for seeking a sale on his own account and its acceptance by the principal as a seller is the distinction between the liability of the seller (the principal) and is the distinction between the liability of the seller (the principal) and the liability of the buyer (the agent). ■ The basis for the obligation of specifying the wages of the agent, and not merging it with the price is the Hadith: “He who hires a hired worker must make known to him his wages”.(6) This rule of the contract of Ijarah is applicable to agency for wages. ■ The basis for the prohibition of stipulating the lack of delivery in com modity sales is that this negates the requirements of sale, which are the transfer of ownership to the buyer and his right to undertake transactions in the sold commodity. ■ The basis for prohibiting the stipulation of a guarantee by the agent is that the agent is a trustee and does not provide a guarantee except for cases of transgression, negligence or going against the constraints of agency. ■ The bases for the prohibition of deferred transactions in currencies are the Hadiths prescribing the obligation of possession in their sale. This has received support from a resolution of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy emphasising this.(7) ■ The basis for the prohibition of derivatives is that these are binding promises that are converted to sale contracts pertaining to the future without an offer and acceptance. The Shari’ah substitutes mentioned in the Standard for derivatives are stated in a resolution of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy.(8) ■ The basis for the impermissibility of options is that the subject-matter The basis for the impermissibility of options is that the subject-matter of the contract in them is not wealth that can be deemed compensation according to the Shari’ah.(9) ■ The basis for the impermissibility of swaps is that no actual exchange of counter-values takes place thereby. Such swaps, as well, usually constitutes interest payment, ’Inah, and deferment of one of the counter-values.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Issuance of Shares ■ The basis for the permissibility of the issuance of shares, when the objectives for which the corporation has been established are permissible, is the basis for the permissibility of the corporation (Sharikat al-Musahamah), which is the generality of the evidences conveying the obligation of abiding by contracts and conditions, the generality of the evidences conveying the permissibility of partnership, and the generality of the evidences conveying the permissibility of ’Inan, Mudarabah, Musaqat and Muzara’ah. ’Inan is the basis for the permissibility of participation by two or more persons with their wealth and labour, just as Mudarabah, Musaqat and Muzara’ah are the basis for the permissibility of participation with wealth from one side and labour from the other side whether the subject-matter of the contract is cash, as in the case of Mudarabah, or is tangible assets that are developed with work on these assets, as in the case of Musaqat and Muzara’ah. The evidences for all these forms are well known. ■ The basis for the permissibility of underwriting the issue without The basis for the permissibility of underwriting the issue without com pensation is that it is an undertaking that does not have a coun ter-value, which is the taking of compensation for it. In this regard a resolution of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy has been issued.(2) ■ The basis for the impermissibility of the issuance of preference shares, that The basis for the impermissibility of the issuance of preference shares, that is, in other than the prescribed manner, is that this leads to the severance of participation in profit and the imposition of injustice on the other shareholders.(3) ■ The basis for the impermissibility of issuing The basis for the impermissibility of issuing Tamattu’ shares is that the owners of these shares claim their rights to profit and their redemption is only in form as they continue to be owners of these share and are entitled to rights at the time of liquidation. ■ The basis for the permissibility of share being in a person’s name, at his order, or for bearer is that the Lawgiver wishes to establish rights through writing and other forms, but He has not determined a particular form for this. If -in the case of corporations- this takes place through the is suance of shares on which names of the shareholders are written then this is valid. Likewise, if this is undertaken by recording the names of the shareholders in special registers, or indexes, or in any other way, or even if the names are not recorded at all -neither on the certificates nor elsewhere- then this is permissible. Trading in Shares ■ The basis for the permissibility of the sale and purchase of shares of cor porations, when the activity of the corporation is permissible, is that the shares are owned by the shareholder, and he has the right to undertake transactions in them as he desires whether this is by way of sale, gift or another way, especially when each one of the shareholders has been granted permission to undertake such transactions through their parti cipation in the memorandum of the corporation and by subscribing to it. ■ The basis for the permissibility of participation by one who has the ability to convert or makes an effort to convert insofar as that is a means to alter the rejected and belongs to the category of al-Amr Bil Ma’ruf Wa al-Nahy ’An al-Munkar (enjoining good and forbidding evil), which is an act approved by acknowledged evidences. In this regard a jurstic opinion (Fatwa) has been issued by the Third Seminar on Fi nancial Markets.(4) ■ The basis for exempting trading in the shares of these corporations, whose primary activity is permissible, however, they deposit amounts and borrow on the basis of interest, is the application of the rule of removal of hardship and acknowledging of general need, widespread practice, the of hardship and acknowledging of general need, widespread practice, the acknowledged principles of surplus, shortage and predominance,(5)as well as the permissibility of dealing with one the major part of whose wealth is permissible,(6)along with reliance upon the issue of separation of bargains according to some Jurists.(7) This is upheld by most fatwa issuing organisations as well as the Shari’ah Supervisory Boards of Islamic banks.(8) ■ The basis of the impermissibility of buying shares by raising interest-bearing loans from the broker or someone else, is the indulgence in interest and securing this through mortgage, and these are activities prohibited by the Texts along with a curse for those who charge Riba, pay it, write it down and witness it. ■ The basis for the impermissibility of the sale of shares that the seller does The basis for the impermissibility of the sale of shares that the seller does not own is that this leads to the sale of something that is not within the liability of the seller nor in his ownership, and this is prohibited accor ding to the Shari’ah. ■ The basis for the permissibility of undertaking transactions in shares even though the final registration formalities have not been completed is the transfer of the liability for loss (Daman) to the buyer. This is attained through constructive possession that is granted through the transacting in what he has purchased. ■ The basis for the impermissibility of lending the shares of corporations is that the share at the time of repayment-in consideration of what it repre sents-does not represent the same thing that it did at the time of lending due to the constant change in the assets of the corporation. ■ The basis for the permissibility of mortgaging the shares of corporations The basis for the permissibility of mortgaging the shares of corporations is the established principle that a thing can be mortgaged if its sale is permissible. As the sale of shares is permitted, mortgaging them is also permitted. The reason is that the purpose of a mortgage is the securing of a loan and recovering it through the sale price of the asset mortgaged in case recovery is not possible from the debtor. This is what is achieved through the mortgaging of shares and is, therefore, permitted. ■ The basis for the impermissibility of Salam in shares is that the sub The basis for the impermissibility of Salam in shares is that the sub ject-matter of Salam is a debt and not an ascertained thing, while in shares of corporations nothing works except ascertainment. This is done by mentioning the name of the corporation whose shares are desired through Salam thereby rendering the shares an ascertained thing and not a liability for a debt. Shares cannot, therefore, essentially be the sub ject-matter of the contract of Salam. Further, Salam in shares implies the sale of ascertained things that are not owned and this is not permitted. In addition to this, the constant availability of specified shares in the market and the ability of the buyer to deliver them at the end of the period is something that cannot be guaranteed. ■ The impermissibility of concluding futures contracts for shares is that these contracts imply the stipulation of delay in the delivery of an as certained sold commodity, that is, shares, and this prohibited and not permitted. Likewise, the delay in the price and the priced commodity, for this is the sale of a debt for a debt, which is prohibited by agreement. Further, the seller -mostly- does not own the shares for which the futures contract has been concluded and is, therefore, selling something that is owned by another. This is something over which there is no disagree ment among the scholars as to its impermissibility. It is also included primarily in the meaning of the Shari’ah Texts established By Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) that convey the prohibition of the sale of something that one does not possess. Again, most of the futures contracts are completed through a cash settlement between the parties, and this is brazen gambling if this is stipulated within the contract. If it is not stipulated in the contract, it is still one type of gambling. Thereaf ter, the purpose of contracts is the delivery of possession, while in fu tures contracts delivery of possession is not the primary purpose of the contracting parties. These contracts, thus, create an obligation for, and engage the liability of, each party for a debt that is of no benefit, except by way of Mukhatarah and for waiting for a loss that will inevitably be incurred by one party. ■ The basis for the impermissibility of concluding options contracts for shares is the right of option- which is the subject-matter of options contracts transacted in financial markets- is not included in rights that can be sold. The reason is that this right is not established at all for the seller as it is created through the contract and after its creation it is not related to wealth rather it is related to an abstract thing, that is, sale and purchase. If established rights cannot be sold when these do not relate to wealth, like the right of pre-emption, the right to custody of children, the right of Qisas, then, rights -like the right of option- cannot be permitted in the first instance. Added to this is the fact that dealing in options contracts is based on Gharar, and Gharar is prohibited, just like dealing in options contracts is based upon gambling and games of chance, equally for the buyer and the seller of a right to an option, and this occurs in cases that terminate in a cash settlement between the two parties. The contract for an option falls under the sale by a person of something that he does not own when he writes an option to buy, for he does not own the shares or commodities that he undertakes to sell; and the sale of what one does not own is prohibited according to the Shari’ah. ■ The basis for the impermissibility of concluding swap contracts for the dividends of shares is that these contracts include Riba in both its forms if the contracts involve the same currency, or Riba al-Nasi`h alone if it invol ves two different currencies; the sale of a debt for a debt as it is a contract in which both counter-values are deferred; Gharar due to the uncertainty about the amount of the cash at the time of the contract; gambling, as the purpose of these contracts is the acquisition of the difference between the two average returns on the shares and it is not the delivery of possession, which is the purpose of contracts, thus, one of the parties gains and the other inevitably loses, and this is truly gambling. Each one of these prohi bitions alone is sufficient to prohibit this type of contracts, then what about all of them collectively? ■ The basis for the permissibility of trading in shares or corporations, which The basis for the permissibility of trading in shares or corporations, which include cash assets and debts, without regard for the rules of Sarf and dea ling in debts, even when such debts are more than one-half, is that in such circumstances such assets are deemed secondary, and in secondary things matters that are not normally overlooked otherwise are overlooked. If, however, the tangible assets and benefits are less than a third, it is not permitted to deal in the shares, except by observing the rules of Sarf or transactions in debts, because in such a case the assets and benefits are meagre and here debts and cash cannot be deemed secondary to them, and they are the primary objective of the contract, thus, those conditions are to be stipulated for them that would be applied to them if they were desired separately. ■ The basis for the permissibility of trading in shares of corporations whose The basis for the permissibility of trading in shares of corporations whose assets include debts and cash, when the objective and activity of the corpo assets include debts and cash, when the objective and activity of the corpo ration is dealing in things and benefits, without regard for the percentage of debts and cash, is as follows: 1. The Hadith of Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) stating: “... When a person buys a slave, who has wealth, then the wealth is for the seller, unless the buyer stipulates this too.”(9)The Hadith is explicit on the permissibility of the sale without regard for the genus of the price. The general meaning of the Arabic term “Mal” in the Hadith includes all his wealth whether this is cash, debts or goods and whether all his wealth whether this is cash, debts or goods and whether this is less or more. It indicates that debts or cash, less or more, in comparison with the price of the slave are not taken into account in the Hukm, because they are in this case secondary and are not the primary purpose of the contract. Imam Malik relates this Hadith in Al-Muwatta` and then says: “The matter is settled unanimously in our view that if the buyer stipulates the wealth of the slave then it belongs to him, whether this is cash or debt or goods, known or unknown. This applies even if the wealth owned by the slave is more than that with which he is purchased, and irrespective of whether the price is cash debts or goods.”(10) 2. The Hadith of Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) stating: “When a person buys a palm-grove after pollination, then the fruit is for the seller, unless the buyer stipulates this too.”(11)The Hadith conveys the permissibility of an absolute stipulation on the part of the buyer for the fruit whether or not the fruit has begun to ripen despite the prohibition of the sale of fruit before it has begun to ripen, as is found in the Hadith of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him)saying: “The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) forbade the sale of fruit be fore it has begun to ripen.”(12)As the fruit was secondary to the prima ry subject-matter, which was the palm-grove, it was overlooked when it would not be if it was the only subject-matter of the contract. 3. Among the established principles of Fiqh according to the scholars is that the secondary is subservient. One who examines the various issues flowing from this principle, and the cases structured upon the principle, will find that these principles as a group convey the meaning that the secondary thing will take the rule of the primary and will not be assigned a separate rule; it will come to be owned along with the ownership of the primary, and something that will not be overlooked separately will be overlooked when the thing is secondary. Among the cases derived from the rules are the following: a) The subservience of what has not begun to ripen to what has begun to ripen even when what is ripening is very little. It is stated in “Kashshaf Al-Qina’” as follows: “The ripening of some of the fruit of a tree in a garden is its ripening, that is, of the tree as well as the ripening of all that falls in this category in a single garden. … It becomes valid with what has begun to ripen as it is subsidiary to it.”(13) b) The sale of a house, whose roof is painted with gold, for gold, or is painted with silver for silver; the sale of a sword ornamented with gold for gold; the sale of milk for milk; or a thing made of wool for wool and so on. Issuance of Bonds ■ The basis for the impermissibility of issuing interest-bearing bonds is The basis for the impermissibility of issuing interest-bearing bonds is that they represent, in their customary nature, a loan and the meaning of a loan is applied to them in their nature according to the Shari’ah. As each loan that yields a benefit is Riba, and the issuance of bonds is based upon loans with interest, their issuance is prohibited according to the Shari’ah. Dealing in (Negotiation of) Bonds ■ The basis for the impermissibility of dealing in bonds is what has been settled with respect to their issuance due to their being based on Riba. The reason is that the word negotiation includes the meaning of conti nuity and the transfer of the bond from one hand to another bearing interest benefits. This means that the buyer of a bond continues to be a creditor of the issuing corporation and demands Riba for his debt. This is impermissible according to the Shari’ah, and all dealing leading to this is impermissible.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Concession for Utilization of Minerals ■ The right of the State to regulate survey or exploration of minerals, water and the like by offering exclusive rights of utilization, stems from the fact that such an act by the State leads to realization of public interest and prevention of disputes. This reasoning is adopted by the fuqhaa who argue that development of wasteland requires State permission. The basic assumption here, knowingly, is that when the State disposes of public property, its act is supposed to be that of serving the cause of public interest, which should always surpass private interest. ■ The distinction between survey on the one hand, and exploration and concession on the other, and the fact that only the latter two can enable the licensee to have the exclusive status as a contractor, stems from the fact that survey is based on mere expectation, while exploration is like Tahjir (retention) in wasteland development, which usually precedes utilization. Thus, offering the exclusive right to the explorer can be based on the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Whom who develops a piece of wasteland shall become its owner.”(2) ■ The ruling that gives the one who discovers the minerals the priority in utilizing them is extracted from the fact that exploration resembles wasteland development, which entitles to ownership of the developed land. ■ The alternate viewpoint of the Maliki School, which considers minerals as the property of Bayt al-Mal (treasury) even when discovered in a pri vate land, leans towards the fact that no body, the landlord included, can claim the honor of bringing these minerals into being. Putting the minerals at the disposal of the State, therefore, does not leave any room for dispute between the property owner and the one who discovers the minerals. ■ The viewpoint of the majority of the Fuqaha, including the Maliki School, that the minerals are the property of the landowner, focuses on their pers pective that deems land ownership as underground resources. Moreover, the fact that the Kharaj imposed on land is one fifth indicates that the remaining four fifths are the property of the landowner. ■ Eligibility of the holder of the concession for utilization of minerals to other rights pertaining to production and transportation devices is due to the fact that such rights constitute the complementary requirements. This reasoning also holds true for eligibility of the licensee to the easement rights pertinent to one’s license. ■ The condition that the licensee should sustain the activity in question originates from the Shari’ah ruling on the case of a person who retains a piece of wasteland for a period of time without developing it. In this connection it has been narrated that Caliphate Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said: “When somebody develops a piece of wasteland that had been left for three years undeveloped by its original owner, the land becomes the property of the developer”(3) ■ Eligibility of the State to purchase the quantity it requires from the output of the project is justifiable by the need to realize public interest without harming the licensee, since purchasing takes place according to the procedures and conditions available to other clients. With regard to the right of the State to fix the price of the product, the justification is hinged on the need to prevent social injury that could result from charging unduly high prices by licensee. ■ The State is given the right of amending concession contracts for mine rals when necessary, because the acts of the State are normally considered to be in pursuance of public interest, which should always surpass private interest. Concession for Construction of Projects ■ Project construction contracts are permissible because they come under commitments that should be honored by virtue of the divine ordain of Allah, Exalted be He, Who says: {“fulfill (all) obligations”}(4) and also the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Muslims honor all their obligations except those which permit prohibited deeds or prohibit permitted deeds”(5) ■ Permissibility of remunerating the licensee by allowing him to benefit from the project before handing it over to the licensor, relates to the fact that in Istisna’a, temporary benefiting from the product may constitute the price of its production. That is to say, the price can be either money or usufruct including that of the product in question. This viewpoint has been confirmed by a similar resolution of the Al Baraka Seminar.(6) The other viewpoint referred to in this Standard is that the price should be fixed first, and then the licensee is given the chance to utilize the project until he gets the remuneration agreed upon, regardless of any specific period of time. The basis for this viewpoint is that a predetermined period may not be sufficient for getting the full price. This viewpoint, therefore, seems to visualize the relationship between the State and the Institution as a management relationship, as well as a clearance arrangement with regard to the price to be paid and the period of utilization. ■ Permissibility for Institutions to enter into concession contracts with the State directly or as intermediaries is clear because they do this in a permissible contractual form such as Ju’alah, Mudarabah, Musharakah, Istisna’a and Ijarah. All these contractual forms are permissible whether performed directly or though entering as an intermediary between the State and the other original party to the contract. Management Contracts ■ Permissibility for the State to offer concession licenses for management of public utilities is justified by the fact that the State has the right of regu lating such facilities and collecting fees, and therefore it can transfer this right to a second party. The management contract in this case is Ijarah and the government has the right of identifying the lessee on the ground of common interest. ■ Permissibility of fixing the contract’s value in terms of money is that the deal is considered as Ijarah, and determination of the contract’s value as a specific share of the project’s income could embody uncertainty (Jahalah) pertaining to the possibility of realizing the agreed upon amount during the contract’s period. The relationship between the State and the licensee, in this sense, is considered as an Ijarah deal. If such relationship is consi dered as Mudarabah, the basis for determination of the contract’s value will become a given share of the project’s profit, which can be determined only after preservation of the project’s capital, which is the managed asset in this case. The Hanbalis permit Mudarabah on income-generating as in this case. The Hanbalis permit Mudarabah on income-generating as sets like animals. The reason behind the justification for sharing the net profit after allocations is the preservation of the project’s capital. ■ Permissibility for licensor to rescind the contract when the other party breaches a condition or fails to fulfill an obligation is derived from the commitment of Muslims to honor contractual obligations according to the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him) stating: “Muslims shall honor their obligations”",

In addition, a guarantee given by a party acting as an agent in respect of an investment turns the transaction into an interest-based loan, since the capital of the investment is guaranteed in addition to the proceeds of the investment, (i.e. as though the investment agent had taken a loan and repaid it with an additional sum which is tantamount to Riba). But if a guarantee is not stipulated in the agency contract and the agent voluntarily provides a guarantee to his principals independently of the agency contract, the agent becomes a guarantor in a different capacity from that of agent. In this case, such an agent will remain liable as guarantor even if he is discharged from acting as agent”.",

    "section_title": "Appendix (B)",
    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard ■ Permissibility of agency by Shari’ah is demonstrated in the noble Qur`an, where Allah, Exalted be He, says: {“...So send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the town, and let him find out which is the good lawful food...”}.(2) Similitude of this incidence to agency is that the one who was sent to the town to buy the food was the agent of the others.(3) In Sunnah, a Hadith was narrated by Urwah Al-Bariqi (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace be upon him) had given him one dinar to purchase a sacrificial sheep for the Prophet,(4) an incidence that involves agency. As regards to Ijma’ (consensus of Fuqaha), the author of the “Al-Bahr Al-Zakhkhar” and others have demonstrated permissibility of agency. Also, in common sense agency is well demonstrated in terms of the help of others that one may sometimes need, especially for things that he cannot do himself.(5) ■ Permissibility of initiating agency in any wording which indicates initiation thereof is based on the fiqh principle that “What matters in contracts are intentions and meanings rather than wording and constructions”. Therefore, whatever indicates delegation, which is the essence of agency, is acceptable for initiating the contract. The underlying reason for consideration of silence as acceptance in case of non-paid agency is that acceptance in this case is considered to have been given implicitly(6). Effectiveness of the agency contract can be linked to fulfillment of a certain condition or to a future date because agency is delegation of power rather than an act of ownership transfer that could be required immediately. On the contrary, a person may need to tie delegation to the occurrence of a certain incidence, or to a specific date in the future. ■ The principal shall possess the right of disposing of the asset in question The principal shall possess the right of disposing of the asset in question because the agent is going to derive such right from him; hence the former cannot delegate a right that he does not own(7). ■ As for the detailed rulings pertaining to partial legal capacity of the agent, these rulings hold true for all dealings including agency. ■ The ruling that agency should be known to the agent is manifested in the fact that knowledge in this case is a necessity for completion of the pro cess of offer and acceptance, and hence distinction between a real agent and an uncommissioned agent. ■ Imposition of four conditions on the subject matter of agency is necessary to facilitate conclusion and validity of the contract that cannot be attained without these four conditions namely: existence of the asset, asset ownership by the principal, possibility of disposing of the asset through agency and the absence of any Shari’ah restriction that prevents the deal. ■ Permissibility of paid agency stems from the fact that agency is a useful work for which the agent has the right to ask remuneration. An agent who is known to be providing agency services only against payment is entitled to remuneration even when remuneration is not explicitly mentioned in the contract, because a customary practice is acceptable as long as it does not encounter a Shari’ah restriction. Non-paid agency is also permissible because it is considered, in this case, as a form of donation. ■ The justification for the clauses relating to remuneration of the agent is that such clauses are essential to make remuneration well known at either the time of the contract conclusion or in the future. Temporary uncertainty about the exact amount of the remuneration is overlooked because knowledge of the amount in the future will leave no room for dispute.(8) Permissibility of adding a certain share of the profit to the principal remuneration rests on the fact that such addition does not distort knowledge of the principal amount. In this case, the commitment to offer the agent a certain share of the profit is in the sense of a pledge to offer donation. Thus, the offered share of the profit can be considered as a conditional gift, or as Ju’alah. There is another viewpoint that considers the pledged share of the profit as a subsidiary addition to the principal remuneration, and concludes that in a subsidiary we can overlook what we cannot overlook in the principal. ■ Agency is, originally, non-binding because it is an act of delegation that neither the principal nor the agent should be forced to continue. The exceptional cases of binding agency have been dealt with to preserve whatever rights of others involved therein. Moreover, an exceptional treatment is also needed for paid agency that should be subjected to the treatment is also needed for paid agency that should be subjected to the rulings on Ijarah, as well as the case when there is a pledge not to revoke the contract within a specific period because breaching such commit ment may cause injury to others. ■ It is permissible to specify a time limit for agency, because agency is nothing but a contract that could have a specific duration, like Ijarah for instance. ■ The justification for defining the commitments of the principal and the agent is – as set out in the Standard- the need to honor contractual obli gations of agency and pursue the acts and liabilities that emerge from it. ■ The agent is considered as a trustee in holding the asset because he works for the interest of others (the principal) and trusteeship is the normal status in similar engagements. Moreover, the principal’s act of choosing the agent for the purpose in question is an indication of his good faith on him, and therefore the principal should not reverse that good faith, except for misconduct, negligence or breach of the contract’s limitations. ■ Impermissibility of combining agency and guarantee in the same contract, is based on their opposing implications, in addition to the fact that guarantee by the agent entails a suspicion of Riba (usury). Therefore, the status of the agent as a trustee contradicts with provision of guarantee. ■ Impermissibility for the agent to represent both parties to the contract – as per the Hanafi School and the predominant view in the Shafi’i School – is to avoid assigning both offer and acceptance to the same party, and hence prevent any probable self bias. Adopting the viewpoint of these two Schools is, therefore, most suitable for Institutions to avoid malpractices and misleading formalism in making transactions and prevent overlapping of guarantees. ■ Monitoring of the contract’s provisions is assigned to the principal because he is the principal party of the contract, whereas the agent, who is just a contractor, has to monitor the activities of the contract. ■ Suspension of an agent act that breach the contract without adding to the benefit of the principal, until obtaining the principal’s approval conforms to the normal Shari’ah practice of exerting the best possible effort to rectify an act of a Muslim.(9) The act here remains pending approval of the princi pal to safeguard him against injury. ■ An agent who breaches the contract by selling or buying at a price other than the price agreed upon has to indemnify the principal for the diffe rence between the price he accepted/offered, and the market price. The justification for this ruling is the need to establish justice and compensate the principal for loss, without committing the Shari’ah-banned practice of accepting capital on pre-fixed return, which entails a suspicion of Riba. This case has been discussed in “Al-Mughni” by Ibn Qudamah, who refer red also to another viewpoint that suggests revocation of the deal.(10) ■ Agency in selling a mortgaged asset is treated as an exceptional case where the contract does not expire on the death of the agent (agency to be pursued by inheritors), in order to preserve the rights of the mortgagee. Moreover, such agency is originally irrevocable before fulfillment of its purpose, for thereto is attached others’ rights. ■ The justification for adopting the fiqh viewpoint that advocates suspen ding the act of the uncommissioned agent rather than revoking the deal (for uncertainty about its confirmation by the principal), is the fact that an act of a Muslim should, as far as possible, be preserved from cancellation.(11) Preservation of the act against cancellation is possible here through sus pension, in addition to the fact that the act may prove to be useful to the owner of the property in question. In this connection, Ibn Al-Humam said: “When the case is viewed from the standpoint of Gharar (uncer tainty), the contract appears to be invalid, whereas if it is viewed from the standpoint of benefit and absence of harm the contract appears to be permissible. Therefore, Ibnul Humam supports reconciliation of the two standpoints by suggesting permissibility with suspension.”(12) It has also been narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Whoever can offer a benefit to his Muslim brother, should do so”. If, however, the act turned to be harmful to the principal, he can revoke it by virtue of the right he has. Moreover, permissibility of suspending the act of the uncommissioned Moreover, permissibility of suspending the act of the uncommissioned agent until approval of the principal can also be derived from the Hadith narrated by Hakim Ibn Hizam (May Allah be pleased with him) stating that the Prophet (peace be upon him) gave him one dinar so as to buy a sheep that the Prophet (peace be upon him) wanted to sacrifice. Hakim purchased the sheep for one dinar and sold it for two. Then he purchased another sheep for the Prophet (peace be upon him) for one dinar and handed over the remaining dinar to him. The Prophet (peace be upon him) took the remaining dinar and spent it on charity and then prayed to Allah to bless Hakim’s trading business.",

    "section_title": "Appendix (B)",
    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Permissibility of Syndicated Financing ■ Permissibility of syndicated financing is derived from Musharakah, which encounters no Shari’ah restriction. Projects Financed Through Syndication ■ The ruling that syndicated financing should be directed only towards ac tivities that do not entail dealing in a Shari’ah-impermissible commodity or service, is dictated by the need to abide by the directives outlined in the Holy Qur`an verses and the noble Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him). These divine sources prohibit usury, alcoholic drinks, drugs, gam bling, pork, illegitimate carcasses, prostitution, nightclubs, statues, etc, as bling, pork, illegitimate carcasses, prostitution, nightclubs, statues, etc, as well as impermissible acts like deception, bribe, cheating in weight and measurement, and all types of prohibited sales, etc.(2) Participation of Institutions with Conventional Banks in Syndicated Financing, and Permissibility of Assigning the Role of the Lead Manager to a Conventional Bank ■ Partnership between a Muslim and a Non-Muslim is not prohibited or cannot be judged right away as invalid, except in case of Shari’ah-banned dealings. This is so because what really matters is the conformity of the deal in question to the rulings of Shari’ah, rather than whether the deal has been made by a Muslim or a Non-Muslim. This viewpoint has been adopted by the Al Baraka Seminar,(3) as well as the Fourth Fiqhi Seminar of the Kuwait Finance House (1995). This case also does not come under the Hadith stating that the Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibited involiving in partnership with a Jew or a Christian unless purchase and sale take place by the hands of the Muslim.(4) It is clear that the emphasis of prohibition here relates to avoidance of Riba and invalid contracts, and therefore, no justification for prohibition will remain if due preventive measures against prohibited practices are well catered for. Also, the viewpoint of the Shafi’i, Maliki, Hanbali and Hanafi Schools(5) who advocate Karahah (disinclination towards the deal) does not include this case. The reason is that the Musharakah can avoid Shari’ah-banned practices by explicit reference to the firm commitment of the conventional Institution that leads the syndication to Shari’ah rulings in transactions, besides tightening the control and supervision of the Shari’ah boards of the participating Institutions throughout the various stages of the syndicated financing operation. Preparatory Tasks and Commissions ■ Permissibility of receiving commissions for performing preparatory tasks, originates from the fact that such tasks are beneficial to the partners and do not embark on any Shari’ah-impermissible practice. As regards the justification for the ruling that the commission can be equal to, less or more than the actual cost of providing the tasks, it is because the two parties are free to make what is known as a permissible condition, or resort to mutual consent. This same viewpoint was the Fiqhi opinion of the Al Baraka Seminar as well as the Fiqhi Seminar of the Kuwait Finance House (1995). ■ Receiving commitment commission is prohibited because such commis sion is paid for exercising the right of contracting, which is a matter of will and desire, rather than a subject matter of compensatory deals.(7) Provision of Guarantee and Suretyship by the Lead bank ■ A lead bank should not provide guarantee except in case of misconduct and negligence. Being a partner in the operation, it is supposed to be holding the assets as a trustee, and hence, it should not provide any guarantee. Stating such guarantee in the contract constitutes a violation of the Shari’ah rulings on trusteeship. When the managing bank commits misconduct or negligence, or resort to fraud and trickery in the studies it prepares, it should then indemnify the partners for the injury it has deliberately caused to them. ■ A bank that manages the syndication through Mudarabah or Musharakah should not provide a warranty cover against default of the debtors of its partners, or guarantee the contributions of these partners against exchange rate fluctuations, because provision of guarantee by a partner or a Mudarib to his other partners/owners of the capital is prohibited by Shari’ah. ■ When the bank manages the syndication as an agent, it may provide a warranty cover for the debtors of his partners in a separate contract and without referring to warranty in the agency contract. The justification here is that the bank does not provide such warranty in its capacity as an agent of the partners, and the warranty thus provided against default of the debtors will remain valid even if the agency contract is revoked. Exchange Rates ■ Permissibility for the parties of the syndication to make their contributions in currencies other than that of the syndication on condition that such contributions be revaluated according to the prevailing exchange rates is derived from a Hadith narrated by Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). Ibn Umar said: “When I told the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that I used to sell camels at Al-Baqi’ in dinars and receive the value in dirhams, he (peace be upon him) said: ‘No harm if you apply the exchange rate of the same day and finalize the deal with your partner before leaving each other’.”(8) This case also implies combining currency exchange and Hawalah (transfer of money), which has been approved by a resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Academy.(9) ■ The Hadith narrated by Ibn Umar also justifies the fiqhi opinion that the participating Institutions can stipulate receiving their profits and other en titlements in a currency other than that of the syndication, and according to the prevailing exchange rate on the day of receiving such profits and entitlements. ■ Prohibition of commitment of one party of the Musharakah or Muda rabah to safeguard the other party against exchange rate fluctuations is because such commitment leads to the impermissible case of a partner or a Mudarib provides to the other partner guarantee against loss of capital. Controls on Disassociation ■ Participating Institutions can agree on a closed syndicated financing operation where premature exit is not allowed. Such a condition is regarded as a proper condition in Shari’ah, and it does not contradict with the aim of the contract. Moreover, imposing a condition against premature exit does not lead to permitting what Shari’ah has prohibited or prohibiting what it has permitted, nor does it seem to be a probable cause of future dispute.(10) Therefore such condition should be honored in abidance to the divine order of Allah, Exalted be He, in the holy Qur`an: {“O you who believe! Fulfill (all) obligations...”}(11) ■ Agreement beforehand on exit at nominal value or on guaranteeing a certain amount of profit is prohibited because such condition entails exact Riba, or a suspicion of it. Moreover, it involves other Shari’ah impermissible practices like the case of one party providing a guarantee against the loss of the share of the other party in the capital, or guarantees a predetermined rate of profit for him.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard ■ It is permissible to combine more than one contract in a single transaction as long as each of these contracts is permissible on its own. This is so because freedom of contracting and honoring commitments is acknowledged in principle by the general teachings and directives of Shari’ah, unless such contracts and commitments lead to violation of Shari’ah rulings.(2) Ibn Al-Qayyim said, “It is permissible in principle to form up contracts and conditions, except for what has been prohibited by Shari’ah.”(3) ■ According to the majority of the Hanafi, Shafi’i and Hanbali Fuqaha, the set of combined contracts can always be judged in the light of its individual components. Therefore, if the transaction comprises a number of contracts that each of them individually satisfies permissibility requirements, the that each of them individually satisfies permissibility requirements, the combined set of such contracts is also permissible. (4) ■ Based on the above fact the Hanbali and Shafi’i Fuqaha, as widely reported, indicate permissibility of combing two contracts, for the same contract value, even if the two contracts differ with regard to Shari’ah status and rulings.(5) Ibn Taymiyyah indicated permissibility of combining two contracts having two separate values.(6) ■ Prohibition of combining contracts in specific cases on exceptional basis, as indicated by Al-Shatibi, stems from the fact that the act of combining could sometimes generate Shari’ah restrictions that do not hold true when the combined acts are taken up individually. Examples of acts that become prohibited when combined, though they are individually permissible, prohibited when combined, though they are individually permissible, include combining sale and lending, marrying two sisters, or marrying a woman and her aunt.(7) ■ The absence of any exceptional Shari’ah restriction in the particular case of combining constitutes the first control on contracts’ combining due to the directives of the Prophet (Peace be upon Him) who has been quoted to have prohibited combining sale with lending,(8) or combining two sales in one deal,(9) or two transaction in one transaction.(10) ■ The second control, which prohibits using Contracts’ Combining as a trick for practicing Riba is based on the directives of the prophet (peace be upon him) which indicate prohibition of Bay’ al-’Inah(11) and Riba al Fadl. As regards Riba al-Fadl, it has been reported that the Prophet (Peace be upon Him) instructed one of his employees to sell his low-quality dates first and then buy the high-quality dates he wanted, instead of resorting to exchange of more quantity of low-quality dates for less quantity of high quality dates.(12) Ibn Al-Qayyim said, “This indicates that the employee was directed to commence the process of purchasing the high-quality dates after the complete finalization of the former transaction; i.e., selling his low-quality dates. If, instead, he agreed beforehand with another party to conduct the two deals successively, the second contract will not become an independent contract, because it is a mere completion of the first one. The directives of the Prophet (Peace be upon Him), apparently necessitate two separate contracts that neither of them is related to or based on the other”.(13) ■ The third control, that prohibits using combined contracts as an excuse for dealing in Riba, is based on the directives of the Prophet (Peace be upon Him) which forbid combining lending with selling.(14) In this regard, the Fuqaha unanimously agree that when the two parties stipulate in the loan contract that the borrower should reward the lender by offering him free accommodation, or grant him a present, or the borrower should make excessive repayment in terms of quantity or quality, the contract becomes null and void. In other words, any loan arrangement that comprises a prior condition on a benefit to be rendered to the lender by the borrower is considered Riba.(15) ■ The fourth control, which indicates that the contracts to be combined should not be contradicting with each other in terms of purpose or Sha ri’ah rulings, stems from the fact that contracts, as indicted by Al-Qarafi, are devices for using appropriate means to achieve specific objectives. Ob viously, the same contracting requirement cannot always fit at the same time two contradicting positions(16). Therefore, contracts that contradict each other in their rulings and effects cannot be combined together in the same transaction. ■ The Shari’ah concessions sanctioned to subsidiary and implicit contracts are based on several statements in “Al-Qawa’id Al-Fiqhiyyah”, including the following: – What can be forgiven in a subsidiary contract cannot be forgiven in other contracts. – What can be forgiven in implicit contracts cannot be forgiven in in dependent contracts. – Concessions that can be sanctioned to implicit provisions cannot be sanctioned to ordinary provisions. – Provisions in ordinary contracts entail more validity requirements than provisions in implicit and subsidiary contract. – Implicit contracts are relieved of what independent contracts cannot be relieved of. – Provisions that hold true in implicit contracts may not hold true in ordinary contracts. ■ Shortcomings like Gharar, which affect financial transactions such as sale contracts and the like, may be forgiven when the contract subject matter or the contract itself is subsidiary. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “When somebody purchases a palm tree, that has not yet been pollinated, the fruits of the tree should belong to the seller unless the buyer stipulates in the contract that he should be entitled to the fruits”.(23) This Hadith in dicates that the reason for ignoring the gharar involved in the act of the buyer who stipulates in the contract that the anticipated fruits of the palm tree should belong to him, is the fact that getting the fruits is an implicit aspect of the contract. As is the case with gharar, excessive Jahalah is also forgivable in subsidiary and implicit contracts. ■ Ignoring sale-based Riba and non-fulfillment of the Shari’ah requirements of currency exchange in subsidiary contracts is based on the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon Him) which states: “When somebody buys a slave who has money, the slave’s money should go to the seller, unless the buyer stipulates in the contract that he should get the money.(24) The justification for this is that the buyer may have taken into consideration (at the time of making his offer) the amount of money the slave could have, be it big or small, and explicitly determined a portion of the price for it, though he did not declare such portion independently. Hence, it becomes clear from this Hadith that it is permissible to buy a slave along with his money without observing the Shari’ah requirements of currency exchange, and regardless of whether the amount of money that the slave has is big or small, known or unknown.(25) ■ Permissibility of Bay’ al-Kali` Bil-Kali` (selling a debt for another debt) in subsidiary and implicit contracts although it is prohibited in original and independent contracts, is based on the previous Hadith about purchasing a slave along with the money he has. In this respect, Imam Malik indicated in “Al-Muwatta`” the permissibility of selling a slave and providing in the contract for the status of the money he owns, even if that money is a debt owed to the slave by a third party and the slave is himself sold on deferred payment. That is to say, Malik seems to have based his opinion on the apparent and general meaning of the Hadith and the ruling practice in Al-Madinah.(26) ■ Permissibility of relieving, upon need or probable interest, subsidiary and Permissibility of relieving, upon need or probable interest, subsidiary and implicit contracts from some of the bases and conditions of contracts’ validity, can be derived from a statement by Al-Sayuti in “Al-Ashbah Wa Al-Naza`ir”. In that statement, Al-Sayuti indicates permissibility of abandoning offer and acceptance (the form) in case of implicit sale, or accepting deferred, instead of spot, delivery/payment in such sales. Such rulings in fact come as further ramifications of the Fiqh principle that “Subsidiary contracts can be relieved from what other contracts cannot be relieved from” ■ Muwata`ah for combining contracts is considered as an enforceable condition that precedes the signing of the contract, because Muwata`ah, traditionally as well as in fiqh terminology, is an agreement between the two parties to sign contracts and honor pledges in the future. Therefore Ibn Taymiyyah said, “When the two parties agree beforehand to do specific things, and then sign a general contract, the contract should honor that prior agreement”.(28) ■ A condition that precedes the contract should be regarded as binding and enforceable as a one that comes in the text of the contract, because traditionally there is no difference between the conditions stated in the contract and those agreed upon beforehand, even if such prior conditions are not mentioned at the time of signing the contract. This is only natural since these conditions form the bases of the contract, which the two parties have agreed to observe. This viewpoint is supported by a number of traditionally accepted norms such as: – A condition, which the two parties agree to observe, resembles a one explicitly mentioned in the contract. – Traditionally acceptable conditions resemble explicitly stated condi tions. – Intentions in contracts deserve observation. Moreover, enforceability of prior conditions was the ruling practice in Al-Madinah and the predominant opinion in Al-Imam Ahmad’s School.(29) ■ Prohibition of Muwata`ah for devising Riba tricks is because Muwata`ah in this case is a means used for practicing Riba. Consequently, since the end objective (which is Riba) is prohibited, the means used for achieving it must also be prohibited. As indicated in “Al-Qawa’id Al-Fiqhiyyah”, “means are discarded on discarding of objectives” ■ Prohibition of Muwata`ah as an excuse for Riba, originates from the application of the principle of Sadd al-Zara`i’. This principle aims to prohibit permissible practices that could be used as a means for accomplishing Shari’ah-banned objectives.(31) ■ However, application of the principle of Sadd al-Zara`i’ should be based on two requirements as indicated by the Maliki Fuqaha. The first based on two requirements as indicated by the Maliki Fuqaha. The first requirement is that resort to the Zari’ah (excuse) should be very frequent and excessive in view of normal practice, and the second requirement is the presence of a strong accusation that rules out the possibility of any good intention behind using the excuse(32). Application of the principle of Sadd al-Zara`i’ should also observe the non-existence of any need or lawful interest for using the Zari’ah, as has been emphasized by several fiqh principles such as: – Prohibition for the sake of blocking the way to excuses is less force ful than prohibition per se”.(33) – Practices that originate from the need for devising acceptable Shari’ah exits deserve more Shari’ah concessions than other practices.(34) – Acts that are prohibited for the sake of blocking the way to excuses become permissible in case of need or desire to achieve a lawful interest.(35) ■ Permissibility of Muwata`ah for devising acceptable Shari’ah exits can be derived from the statements of several Fuqaha who indicate that using Shari’ah accepted means to achieve permissible objectives is permissible. According to those Fuqaha practicing acceptable Shari’ah exits and helping others to devise them is a permissible and reward-worthy practice as long as it abides by the directives of Allah, Exalted be He, leads to avoidance of sins, and facilitates achievement of lawful interests. ■ Prohibition of Muwata`ah for combining contracts that contradict each other in rulings and objectives is because Muwata`ah in this case is used as a means of doing an unacceptable act. According to Shari’ah, means always follow ends with regard to permissibility and prohibition(37). It has been indicated in “Al-Qawa’id Al-Fiqhiyyah” that: “Disregarding the ends leads to disregard of the means”.(38) ■ Recognition of Muwata`ah when it precedes contemporary transactions, that comprise a set of successive and inseparable contracts forming up a single transaction, is the present day commercial and banking tradition that considers Muwata`ah in this case as binding to the two parties. In fact, Muwata`ah in this sense is part of a whole system that tends to completely collapse when any of its individual components looses balance. Violating Muwata`ah in this case will jeopardize the fulfillment of the objectives of the contracting parties, and may cause them serious injuries. ■ The pledges that relate to an agreement are binding to the two parties since, according to its nature and Fiqh status, and as perceived by most of the Fuqaha, such pledges are similar to the conditions stipulated in the agreement. Enforceability of such pledges also stems from the fact that they constitute the basis for the transaction. It is well known that Shari’ah accepted conditions stipulated in a contract are binding from both the fiqhi as well as the legal viewpoints. Moreover, in present day commercial and banking traditions, such pledges are also considered as binding. Otherwise, it will not be possible for the two parties to form up a definite perception about the purpose and objectives of the contract, and hence they will not be able to sign it.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (C) Definitions Zara`i’ Zara`i’ are the apparently permissible practices used as a means of doing a prohibited act. Therefore, Sadd al-Zara`i’ means prohibition of permissible practices that can be used for committing Shari’ah-restricted acts. However, prohibition in this sense is subject to two restrictions. The first is the existence of a clear intention of the person in question to use the permissible practice for the sake of accomplishing Shari’ah-banned the permissible practice for the sake of accomplishing Shari’ah-banned objectives, and the second is that resorting to prohibition should be only after wide spread of such misconduct in the society. Subsidiaries Subsidiary contracts or objectives in financial transactions refer to the consequent contracts or objectives that follow the original ones. The subsid iary status of these contracts or objectives is usually determined according to tradition, practice and the experience of those who are in the field. Transaction It is a binding contractual relationship that carries no optional choices. ’Inah It is a sale whereby one party, for instance, sells the commodity to the other for one hundred dollars, on deferred payment basis, and repurchases it from the other for eighty dollars payable on spot. In fact, the sale transaction here is nothing but a mere trick for practicing usurious lending, and the commodity is used for no purpose other than facilitating the usurious transaction. The deal in this case has nothing to do with the purposes and objectives of sale, nor does it contain any element of them. In other words ’Inah takes place when one party buys a commodity from the other on deferred payment basis and before making payment sells back the same commodity to the other for a less amount of money payable on spot. Reverse ’Inah It takes place when one party sells the commodity to the other party for a spot price, and the seller repurchases the same commodity from the buyer or from his agent for a higher deferred price. Bay’ al-Raja` (Bay’ al-Wafa`) It is a sale whereby the seller keeps the intention to buy back his sold commodity. One of the most popular forms of this type of sale is when one party, who wants to obtain an interest-bearing loan, agrees to sell an income-earning asset to the lender. The lender will thus become entitled income-earning asset to the lender. The lender will thus become entitled to the income of the asset as long as it remains in his ownership. The buyer then undertakes to return the sold asset to the seller whenever the seller pays back the same price to him. In this manner, the borrower (artificial buyer) succeeds to get the loan amount against payment of the agreed upon interest. Shari’ah-Banned Tricks It refers to those permissible contractual arrangements and other practices, which may be used to achieve prohibited goals like permitting what Shari’ah has prohibited, like escaping duties, deceiving people and performing other Shari’ah-banned practices. Shari’ah Exit (Shari’ah-Acceptable Trick) A Shari’ah exit is an act that is performed for the sake of avoiding com mitment of sins, or achieving a permissible objective, or refraining from prohibited acts, or realizing a Shari’ah-acceptable interest. Separation of the Transaction Separation of a transaction means dividing the object of the same contract, into portions. To Fuqaha, it means a situation in which the provisions of the contract do not cover all the components of its object, or they may cover all of them first, and then shrink down to cover only some of them later on. Thus, either the single transaction is broken down into a number of portions, or only some parts of it are separated in this manner. When separation takes place in this manner in a single transaction between a single buyer and a single seller and for a single price, the buyer should have the option to conclude the deal or not.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard ■ Commercial Insurance is prohibited because it involves Gharar (uncer tainty). In this regard Muslim, Ashab Al-Sunan (compilers of the books of Sunan) and others quoted Abu Hurayrah as having said: “The Prophet peace be upon him prohibited sales which involve Gharar”.(2) ■ The Fuqaha define Gharar in several ways, which -in brief- indicate that it is a process that has unknown/unrevealed consequences and outco mes.(3) ■ Some contemporary scholars believe that Gharar is similar to betting and gambling.(4) ■ Resolutions of Fiqh forums on insurance include the resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Academy in its first session held in 1398 A.H., which endorsed a preceding resolution on the subject issued by the Council of Eminent Shari’ah Scholars of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in its session No. (10) held in Riyadh on 4 April 1397 A.H. A third resolution on the subject was issued by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy - Resolution No. 9 (9/2). ■ Permissibility of cooperative/mutual/social insurance stems from the fact that it is based on cooperation and donation, rather than on Mu’awadah (exchange contract). It is well known among the Fuqaha (Maliki School) that Gharar has no impact on donation contracts. This viewpoint is well supported by a number of Quranic verses and sayings of the Prophet (peace be upon him) which instruct Muslims to promote cooperation. ■ Consequently, several resolutions were issued by Fiqh forums regar ding permissibility of cooperative insurance. Such resolutions include, the resolution of the Islamic Research Academy of Al-Azhar Al-Sharif, the resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Academy of the World Muslim League referred to earlier, and the resolution of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy, which states that: “The contract that respects the origins of Islamic dealings is the cooperative insurance Contract which is based on donation and cooperation…”. The fact that cooperative insurance is permissible, also does not seem to have encountered any dispute among contemporary Muslim Fuqaha.(5) ■ Permissibility of cooperative insurance and non-permissibility of com mercial insurance is in fact due to the following differences: a) The conventional insurance contract is a financial Mu’awadah (exchange contract) that aims at making profit out of the insurance operations. Therefore, its permissibility should be judged in the light of the Shari’ah rulings on financial transactions. Consequently, such rulings prohibit the conventional insurance contract, which involves Gharar. b) In the Islamic insurance contract, the company assumes the role of the agent of the insurance account, whereas in the commercial insurance contract the company is an original party that signs the contract in its own name. c) The company in commercial insurance owns the premiums against its commitment to pay the insurance amount; whereas in Islamic insurance, it is the insurance account rather than the company that owns the contributions. d) In Islamic insurance the residual premiums and the returns on them, that remain after deduction of expenses and indemnity amounts, become the property of the policyholders account, and constitute a surplus, which can be distributed among the policyholders. This cannot be imagined in commercial insurance where the company owns and receives the premiums as soon as it signs the contract. In commercial insurance, the premiums constitute part of the revenue and profits of the company. e) In Islamic insurance, the returns on investment of the premium assets belong to the policyholders account, after deduction of the Mudarib share for the company, whereas such returns belong to the company in commercial insurance. f) Islamic insurance aims at achieving cooperation among the members of the society, rather than generating profits from the insurance operations, whereas commercial insurance is profit-oriented. g) The company in Islamic insurance earns profits through investment of its own funds and its share in Mudarabah, as it assumes the role of the Mudarib and the insurance account assumes the role of the Rab al-Mal (owner of the capital). h) In Islamic insurance, the insurer and the participant are in fact the same person although they differ in recognition, whereas the insurer and the participant are totally different in commercial insurance. i) The company in Islamic insurance adheres to the rules of Islamic Shari’ah and the Fatawa of its Shari’ah Supervisory Board, while in commercial insurance there are no such commitments. j) In Islamic insurance, the allocations from the insurance account, which remain there until the time of liquidation of the company, are spent on charity purposes, and do not go to shareholders, whereas in commercial insurance such amounts go to shareholders. ■ The Shari’ah ruling that the Islamic insurance contract is an act of dona tion that both parties are bound to honor, is measured by analogy to what is known in Fiqh as Nihd,(6) or donation pledge. It has been narrated that Ali and Ibn Mas’ud said: “A gift, if specifically defined, is binding, whether received or not.” It has also been narrated that Abu Bakr and Umar indi cated that a gift does not become binding before receipt.(7) Malik however reconciled the two viewpoints by indicating that Ali, Ibn Mas’ud and the others seem to have focused on the fact that the contract as such is bin ding, while Abu Bakr and Umar seem to have focused on the fact that the receipt of the gift is a prerequisite of finalizing the contract. The lat ter viewpoint was justified by the desire to leave no room for an excuse that Umar explicitly mentioned.(8) The obligatory nature of the donation contract can also be derived from the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him) that: “A person who withdraws his gift is like a dog that with holds its vomit”.(9) ■ The basis of the Shari’ah ruling that the company should not guarantee the insurance assets is that the company is an agent, and the Fuqaha unanimously agree that an agent should not guarantee the property except against misconduct, negligence or breach of the contract. ■ The justification for stating the nine principles of Islamic insurance in the articles of association of the company is the need to preserve the element of donation in the contract and emphasize it as a basic aspect of the company, and hence preserve the cooperative nature and permissibility of the insurance operation. Otherwise, the insurance operation becomes of the insurance operation. Otherwise, the insurance operation becomes a Mu’awadah transaction, and therefore subject to impact of Gharar as mentioned earlier. In other words, emphasis on the nine principles is because they constitute the fundamental differences between Islamic insurance and commercial insurance. Several Fatawa were issued to demonstrate these differences including, Fatwa No. (12/11) issued by the 12th Seminar on Islamic Economics of the Al Baraka Group, Fatwa No. (42/3) issued by the Shari’ah Supervisory Board of the Al Rajhi Company, Fatwa of the Shari’ah Board of Faisal Islamic Bank and Fatwa of the Islamic insurance Company of Jordan.(10) ■ The general framework of the contract and the nature of its conditions have been set up along the lines of binding contracts in Islamic jurisprudence, and the peculiar characteristics of the insurance contracts as far as the insured is concerned. ■ The ruling that the insurer and the insured must fulfill their commitments is based on the Shari’ah prerequisite of honoring contracts. Since the insurance contract is a binding contract, all its conditions should be honored unless they violate the rules of Islamic Shari’ah. Such reasoning is well supported by various Quranic Verses and sayings of the Prophet (peace be upon him) that explicitly instruct Muslims to honor their contracts and conditions. In this regard, Allah, the Almighty, says: {“O You who believe! Fulfill (all) obligations...”}.(11) The Prophet (peace be upon him) also says “Muslims are at their conditions”.(12) ■ The company could manage the insurance account against fee or free of charge because the relationship here is viewed as agency, which the Fuqaha unanimously approve, with or without remuneration. The Fatawa in this regard comprise those of the 12th Seminar on Islamic Economics of the Al Baraka Group (Fatwa No. (12/11), the resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Academy of the Muslim World League – Makkah Al-Mukarramah (Fatwa No. 961), and Fatwa No. (51) of the Council of Eminent Scholars of Saudi Arabia. ■ The basis of assigning the investment of the assets of the insurance fund to The basis of assigning the investment of the assets of the insurance fund to the company is the Mudarabah contract, which the Fuqaha unanimously declare as permissible. Arrangement of investment in this manner entails specification of a profit share for each party, and entitlement of the insurance fund to its respective share. The relevant Fatawa in this regard include the Fatwa of the Shari’ah Supervisory Board of Faisal Islamic Bank,(13) Fatwa No. (12/11) of the 12th Seminar on Islamic Economics of the Al Baraka Group and the Shari’ah Standard No. (13): Mudarabah. ■ The emphasis on honoring commitments in general – including commitment of the company to furnish Qard Hasan to the insurance account – is based on the Shari’ah requirement of honoring pledges that are binding to either of the two parties. This viewpoint to which some leading Fuqaha subscribe is well supported by Qur`an, Sunnah and reported Muslim practice, such as the divine Quranic instruction: {“...Fulfill (all) obligations...”} has been taken by the Fuqaha to comprise any Shari’ah-accepted commitment of the Muslim. There are also several sayings of the Prophet (peace be upon him) which indicate that Muslims are bound to honor their contracts, covenants and pledges.(14) Several resolutions of Shari’ah forums and Shari’ah Boards were also issued in this connection including, resolution No. 40 – 41 (2–5/3) of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy(15) and the Fatwa of the Shari’ah Supervisory Board of the Islamic Insurance Company of Jordan.(16) ■ The ruling that responsibility of providing the evidence lies with the participant depends on the general rules in the Qur`an, the Sunnah and the opinion of the Ulema that evidence should be established by the claimant. This has been indicated in several Fatawa including Fatwa No. (14/6) of the United Shari’ah Board of Al Baraka Group. ■ Permissibility of the two types of Islamic insurance (mentioned in this Standard) rests on the various evidences of permissibility of Islamic insu rance in general, as discussed earlier, and are supported by various Fatawa of Shari’ah Boards. Such Fatawa include Fatwa No. 2/9 of the 2nd Al Bara ka Seminar on Islamic Economics, Fatwa No. 10/3/5 of the 10th Al Baraka seminar on Islamic Economics, and other Fatwa issued by the Shari’ah Supervisory Boards of Dubai Islamic Bank, Kuwait Finance House, Qatar Islamic Bank and the Islamic Insurance Company – Jordan.(17) ■ The rulings relating to the contract as such are based on the general principles of contracts in Islamic Shari’ah, which emphasize avoidance of fraud and deceit and the need to observe the time limits indicated in the contracts. Shari’ah rulings on compensation have also been resorted to in this connection, in addition to the Fatawa and resolutions issued by various forums such as the Islamic Fiqh Academy of the Muslim World League, the Supreme Council of Ulema of Saudi Arabia and the Shari’ah boards of Islamic banks and Islamic insurance companies.(18) ■ The jurisdictions of the company are determined on the basis of its articles of association, the various documents that govern the contractual relationship, the general principles of contracts and conditions, insurance conventions, and some Fatawa of Shari’ah boards. ■ The rules that regulate the relationship between the company and the policyholders are based on the articles of association, which consider this relationship as an agency contract (remunerated or free of charge) for the management of the insurance operations, and Mudarabah for the investment of the insurance assets. ■ Indemnity is based on the general Shari’ah directives emphasizing the principle that “one should neither tolerate harm nor cause it to others”(19) as well as the general principles and rules of Fiqh that advocate fair, and at the same time, non-obsessive indemnification for injury. Furthermore, inferences on indemnity could also be drawn from the cooperative nature of this donation-oriented contract, in addition to some Fatawa such as Fatwa No. (3) of the 10th Al Baraka Seminar on Islamic Economics, and the various Fatawa of the Shari’ah boards of Islamic banks and Islamic insurance companies. ■ Treatment of the insurance surplus is based on the cooperative nature of the contract and the practice of the Sahabah [companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him)] with regard to Nihd, as reported by Bukhari.(21) ■ Possibility of contract termination stems from the fact that the insurance contract is a time-specific contract, and therefore it expires at the end of its stipulated period just like Ijarah (hiring). The insurance contract also expires on the damage of the insured property (or death of the insured), as there will be no object of commitment.",

Insurance Amount It is the amount paid by the company out of the insurance account at the occurrence of the risk insured against. Risk Insured Against It is the probable, legally acceptable, accident. Commercial Insurance It is a contract between an insured party and a technical insuring body, stipulating that the former pays the latter a specific number of financial installments or a lump sum amount, against the commitment of the latter to bear a risk that can be insured against, through payment of an estimated financial indemnity to the insured or the beneficiary, on the occurrence of the risk. [Clause No. (747) of the Egyptian law, Clause No. (773) of the Kuwaiti Law and Clause No. (983) of the Iraqi Law]. Cooperative Insurance A collective insurance contract is a contract whereby each participant undertakes to pay a specific amount of money as donation to indemnify any member of the group who encounters the risk insured against. Islamic Insurance It is a kind of cooperative insurance, which covers all types of risks, under the management of a specialized company that adheres to the rules and principles of Shari’ah. In this sense, Islamic insurance differs from cooperative insurance as the latter only covers a specific group of beneficiaries who might encounter risks, for instance, merchants, sailors and the like while Islamic insurance is available to the general public. Islamic insurance also differs from cooperative Insurance with regard to adherence to the rules and principles of Islamic Shari’ah as well as in some technical aspects per taining to premiums. In cooperative insurance, premiums may be variable at the beginning; whereas in organized Islamic insurance, premiums are specific due to use of precise statistical studies. Mutual Insurance, the Alternate to Life Insurance It is the insurance that covers the risks of death, inability, injury or illness, for the individual or the group, through payment of the insurance amount to the participant or the beneficiary, as per the agreement. Surplus The Surplus comprises of residual premiums of the participants (the insured) in addition to the reserves and profits, after deducting all expenses and indemnity amounts (paid or payable during the same year). The residual amount, thus computed, is considered as surplus, rather than profit. Gharar It is what one cannot predict its unrevealed/unknown consequences. Something that may occur/materialize or may not(22). Participant The Participant is a person who accepts the cooperative insurance scheme, signs the insurance policy and undertakes to observe its conse quent commitments. It may be referred as the insured, the insured for and the policyholder. Insurance Account It is the account established by the company by virtue of its articles of association, to accommodate the premiums of the participants and the returns thereon as well as the reserves. Such account has an independent financial liability towards its own claims and commitments, though it is represented by the company for its all affairs. This account is also known as the insurance fund, the policyholders account or the portfolio of the participants group.",

Resorting to inferences is a well-recognized practice tances (inferences). Resorting to inferences is a well-recognized practice in judicature and financial transactions. Ibn Al-Qayyim in his book on Judicial Methods presented a number of proofs on permissibility of using inferences. ■ Permissibility of using indices to forecast the market situation is derived from acceptability of using inferences for judgment. As indicated above, Shari’ah does not object to using inferences to make current or future judgment based on past events, or to initiate practical actions in the light of probable developments. ■ Selling or buying indices is prohibited because it is nothing more than payment or receipt of money for the mere existence of a certain reading or figure. Such an act constitutes a form of gambling and an illegal act of gaining money. Hence, prohibition of selling or buying indices has been well emphasized by the Resolution of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy which states that it is not permissible to sell or buy an index, because this constitutes pure gambling. It is an act of selling an imaginary object that never exists.(2) ■ Prohibition of concluding option contracts that are based on indices, or on the index contracts’ multiplier, rests on the same reasons for prohibi tion of trading in indices, in addition to prohibition of dealing in options themselves. Such transactions obviously deal with wills and intentions rather than with real commodities. Moreover, prohibition of dealing in options has been clearly stated in a resolution issued by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy.(3) ■ The justification for periodical adjustment of wages subject to changes in the level of prices is to pursue application of a fair wage policy, and protect the money income of the employees against deterioration of purchasing power due to inflation. It is permissible to provide for such a condition in the contract because conditions between contracting parties are permis sible in principle, unless they lead to reversing what has been permitted or prohibited by Shari’ah.",

Such indices precede market movements and measure the rate of price change during the period under study. Ranged Oscillating Indices These are indices that fluctuate between two specific ranges, such as the limit of overbuying and the limit of overselling. Benchmark It refers to any index that represents the performance of a whole industry or a particular activity. It can be used as a standard for measuring the per formance of investment funds and investment units, or used as an indicator for fixing remuneration for management or bonus for the investment agent or the Mudarib. Hedging It is a method for mitigating investment risks (such as market risks) by using financial instruments available in the market to curb down the risks that may arise from severe price changes. Divider It is the total price of the two shares, divided by the average price before division.

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard ■ Fatwa is considered as a collective duty that can be discharged of by any one of those who are able to do it, because it is one of the religious func tions that serve public interest. Therefore, what is required is to have someone in the Muslim community who can issue Fatwa, rather than to have each and every individual of the community able to do so. Fatwa would become the duty of a specific individual or a group only if that individual or group is the only one who can issue it. If Fatwa were to become the duty of every member of the society, things would be more complicated.(2) ■ It is the duty of the institutions to seek Fatwa because otherwise they would not be able to meet their commitments to observe the rules of the Islamic Shari’ah. Therefore, Institutions should approach the boards for obtaining Fatwa. Similarly, it is the duty of the board to issue Fatwa to the Institution due to the relationship that binds the two by virtue of the decision of the general assembly (equity owners) of the Institution. decision of the general assembly (equity owners) of the Institution. ■ Acceptance of the Fatwa of a Shari’ah scholar whose knowledge is confined to only one branch of Fiqh, such as financial transactions in institutions, is based on the viewpoint that Ijtihad (reasoning) and Fatwa may be made partially.(3) ■ Preventing the Institution to adopt the Fatwas of other boards, except when allowed by its own board to do so, stems from the need to bar the way to any tendency of fabrication or attempt to pursue Shari’ah exemptions without observing their relevant controls or their context and circumstances, an act which leads to adoption of irrelevant Fatwas. ■ Permissibility of referring the Fatwa to a higher Shari’ah board or to a Fiqh forum for reconsideration, or making use of collective Fatwa, rests on the fact that an opinion that gains support from a large group of eligible scholars is likely to be more reliable. Moreover, collective Fatwa may facilitate more coordination, and avoidance of discrepancies in the Fatwas of the different boards on the same subject. ■ Withdrawal or refraining from dissemination of a certain Fatwa for fear of being misused is based on the principle of Sadd al-Zara`i’ which advocates the prohibition of a permissible act if it would (certainly or probably) lead to blight. ■ Pursuing Shari’ah exemptions is prohibited because it leads to relaxation of the rules of the Islamic Shari’ah and induce loss of keenness to observe them. Therefore, some Fuqaha hold that pursuing Shari’ah exemptions amounts to Fisq (rebellion against Allah’s Obedience).(4) ■ Choosing the easier ruling when two alternative options are available is supported by the Qur`an in Allah’s Saying: {“Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you”},(5) and by the Sunnah in the Prophetic Hadith stating: “Make things easier not harder...”.(6) All these directives are to be considered after reviewing the specific proofs.(7) ■ The controls relating to the text of the Fatwa are meant to ensure that the Fatwa would achieve its goal without deviating to an invalid meaning. As indicted by Ibn Hamdan(8) in his book “Sifat Al-Fatwa”, drawing attention to these controls and what the ancestor Fuqaha had said about them is meant to ensure the appropriateness of the Fatwa. ■ Permissibility of offering additional information with the Fatwa is shown by the statement of the Prophet (peace be upon him) when he was asked about using seawater for Wudu` (ablution): “Seawater is pure and sea car casses are permissible”. ■ The controls on the Fatwa document aim to preserve Fatwa from being misused.(10) ■ The ruling that a wrong Fatwa should be rectified is supported by the incident when the Caliphate Umar in one case issued a Fatwa that denied some of the brothers the right of inheritance, and later on he issued ano ther Fatwa that granted such brothers the inheritance right. Having done so he said: the former case was subject to my previous Fatwa, and the new one is subject to the new Fatwa.(11) ■ Avoidance of hasty Fatwa should be observed because it was the prac tice of the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) and the other leading Fuqaha who succeeded them. In issuing Fatwa, one should not feel shy to say: I do not know, or to postpone the Fatwa until he is in a position to answer it properly.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard ■ Differentiation between Monetization and ’Inah with regard to permis sibility and prohibition stems from the fact that, contrary to the former, the latter is a trick for practicing Riba (usury). ’Inah takes place between two parties who are in fact a borrower and a lender. The lender sells the commodity to the borrower for a deferred price and buys it back from him for a less price payable on spot. The majority of the Fuqaha subscribe to prohibition of ’Inah and permissibility of monetization, ex cept Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Al-Qayyim who consider monetization as prohibited or worthy of aversion. ■ Permissibility of constructive receipt of the commodity has already been catered for in the Shari’ah Standard No. (18) on Possession (Qabd) and the Shari’ah Standard No. (1) on Trading in Currencies. ■ Permissibility of monetization transactions that observe the Shari’ah controls indicated in this Standard can be traced in the texts of the Qur`an and the Sunnah that permit sale transactions. It has also been confirmed by two resolutions issued by the Islamic Fiqh Academy of the Muslim World League,(2) and the Standing Committee of the Supreme Board of Shari’ah Scholars of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Fatwa No. 19297), as well as the Fatwas of several Shari’ah Supervisory Boards. Therefore, monetization is an exit for avoiding Riba rather than a trick for performing it, as it is usually practiced by those who do not want to be involved in interest-based bor rowing. It has been reported by Abdullah Ibn Al-Mubarak(3) that ’A`ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) practiced it. ■ Prohibition of joining together the contract for purchasing the commodity and the contract for selling it is justified by the fact that joining them together would impose a commitment on the client to sell the commodity right away. Hence, such immediate transfer of the ownership of the commodity may not enable the client to receive it. This is again the same reason for prohibition of agency-related commitments. ■ Permissibly of resorting to agency of the Institution when the client, by virtue of law, cannot sell the commodity directly, is meant to safeguard the deal from being nullified by the law. ■ The ruling that the Institution shall provide detailed information about the commodity to the client aims at preventing fictitious transactions and helping the client to obtain liquidity. Such requirement holds true whether the commodity in question is a commodity, a car, shares of a company, international goods, or local goods. The latter are more suitable for monetization due to the easiness of ensuring their existence, and the chance available to the client to actually hold them if he so desires. ■ The ruling that the Institution shall provide the client with a full description or a sample of the commodity is to ensure that the latter’s act of purchasing the commodity is actual rather than fictitious. ■ Monetization (where the client or the Institution is beneficiary) shall be subjected to strict controls and restrictions so that institutions fulfill the main objectives underlying their presence and the interest of customers to make dealings with them. ■ Principally, institutions have to show strict commitment towards using modes of investment and financing such as the various forms of Musharakah (Partnership) and exchange of goods, usufructs and services that conform to the very nature and basic activities of Islamic banking. Hence, imposition of controls and restrictions on monetization would curb any tendency for expanding monetization to the extent that jeopardizes the extensive use of the original modes of investment and financing. Therefore, Institutions shall not use monetization except in the limited scope defined in this Standard. They shall also restrict the use of monetization to the cases of clients whose transactions cannot be disposed of through other modes of financing and investment such as Musharakah, Mudarabah, Ijarah, Istisna’a and the like. Monetization may also be used as a means for helping the clients to dispose of their previous interest-based debts, after ensuring that they have developed genuine intention not to deal in usurious transactions any more.",

A third example is purchasing the commodity by using a currency which the buyer ignores its issuer and has no indication that could help him to know it.

Sale with forgivable Gharar in price could also include purchasing commodities through Bay’ al- Istjrar, in which the buyer obtains the goods regularly from the seller for a price to be determined subject to the price that people normally sell at, or subject to an index, and even after consumption of the goods in question. A similar sale contract is that which comprises selling, at unit price, of a quantity of the commodity which the buyer can see, yet does not know its exact amount or total value. That is to say, one could sell a quantity of grains at the price per kilogram, or he could rent a car at a rent per mile, so that the payable amount of rent is determined after reaching the target destination.

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard ■ Gharar is divided into excessive, medium and minor, because there is a degree of Gharar which contracts could hardly avoid, whereas there is an excessive degree of Gharar that could become a distinguishing aspect of the contract, such as Bay’ al-Gharar (aleatory sale). In order to specify the two extreme limits of Gharar (excessive and minor) there should be a midpoint of Gharar (medium Gharar). Regarding controls on excessive Gharar, Abu Al-Walid Al-Baji said: “It is the degree of Gharar which becomes so dominant in the contract, that the contract is described in terms of it.”(2) ■ Prohibition of concluding a contract or making a condition that involves Gharar is based on the Hadith (Prophetic tradition) which states: “The Prophet (peace be upon him) has forbidden aleatory sale”.(3) Al-Nawawi said: “This Hadith is a great origin of Shari’ah injunctions on sales and covers an unlimited number of issues.”(4) ■ Assessing excessive Gharar in terms of the four conditions mentioned in this Standard is justified as follows: 1. If Gharar is in an exchange-based contract: Involvement of Gharar in exchange-based contracts would lead to unlawful acquisition of the wealth of other people, whereas it is not so in donation contracts. No dispute would arise in the case of donation contracts, since the recipient of the donation would incur no loss. 2. If Gharar is excessive: This is due to the consensus of the Shari’ah scholars on the impact of excessive Gharar on contracts. They have derived this conclusion from cases in which, due to involvement of excessive Gharar, contracts have been nullified by Hadiths (Prophetic traditions). 3. If Gharar is in the primary subject matter of the contract rather than in a corollary: This is based on the Qa’idah (Fiqh Principle): “What can be forgiven in corollaries is not so elsewhere”. [item (45) of Qwa’id Al-Majallah] 4. If it is not justified by a Shari’ah-recognizable need: This is because 4) If it is not justified by a Shari’ah-recognizable need: This is because Shari’ah has come for the sake of relieving people from hardship, as Allah, the Almighty, states: {“..and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship”}.(5) This holds true whether the need is public or private, as per the Fiqh Principle which states: “Need, whether public or private, enjoys the same status of necessity”. [Qwa’id Al-Majallah, item (33)] ■ A contract which contains Gharar in its form is null and void because it will remain unconcluded. Gharar in this case tends to make finalization of the contract probable rather than definite. This has been derived from a number of similar cases on which strict prohibiting texts are available, such as the types of sales referred to in the Standard as well as other cases indicated in Fiqh sources.(6) ■ The contract is null and void when its subject matter involves Gharar in its kind, nature, type or characteristics, because Gharar in these aspects is excessive and there are Shari’ah texts which prohibit similar sales. Moreover, such cases involve a great deal of Jahalah (ignorance) and, thus, may lead to dispute. Jahalah here cannot be resolved by offering the buyer the option of viewing for instance. ■ The basis for nullity of a contract that involves Gharar in the amount of its subject matter is the consensus of the Shari’ah scholars on denial of ignorance of the amount, whether of the commodity sold or the price. It is also because ignorance of the amount leads to dispute that hinders deli very and receipt.(7) Permissibility of the cases which satisfy the conditions mentioned in this Standard (5/2/1/5 and 5/2), is due to the fact that such conditions make Gharar forgivable. ■ Invalidity of the contract when its duration is unknown rests on the fact that it could generate dispute. Prohibition has been reported about a sale contract known as “Bay’ Habal al-Habalah”, which denotes a type of sale in which the price is postponed until the fetus of the camel is born and has given birth to another camel. The Qur`an has also indicated that indebtedness should have a specific duration: {“O you who believe! when you contract a debt for a fixed period, write it down”}.(8) ■ The nullity of the contract due to Gharar that relates to failure in delivery can be justified in terms of the excessive degree of Gharar it involves. A sale contract is meant to safeguard the rights of both parties (the seller and the buyer). If, instead, the seller is to get the price, while the buyer is unable to get the sold object, this will violate the very objective of the contract. ■ impermissibility of the act of someone selling what he does not own stems from the Hadith which states: “The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, has forbidden people from selling things that they do not own”.(9) Prohibition of selling non-possessed property is also due to the excessive Gharar that failure in delivery could comprise. Gharar relating to failure in delivery is, in fact, the reason behind prohibition of selling a property which the seller does not hold, even legally. This has been derived from a Hadith(10) in this connection. Moreover banning sale of non-possessed property comes under the Fiqh Principle which states: “Any property that neither existent at present nor does its existence in the future is ensured should not be sold”. In this regard also, many scholars have explicitly mentioned that sale of nonexistent property falls under Bay’ al-Gharar (aleatory sale).(11) ■ The Shari’ah basis of the details mentioned in this standard about sale of a nonexistent asset is the degree of Gharar involved therein. Gharar in this type of sale can be avoided only if the asset in question is well described; otherwise absence of viewing may hinder the conclusion of the contract. The Hanafi scholars argue that the buyer should have the option of viewing so that the risk of Gharar can be avoided. ■ The ruling that Gharar does not affect Rahn contracts is based on the fact that the Rahn (Mortgage) contract is not meant in itself, since it is a corollary contract signed for documentation. ■ Similarly, the ruling that Gharar does not affect agency in the strict Sha ri’ah sense is based on the same reasons mentioned in the case of mortgage, besides the fact that agency is primarily based on donation. ■ Suretyship is permissible with Gharar because suretyship is a corollary contract based on delegation of the right of disposal. However, if suretyship is paid for, it becomes an exchange-based contract and, thus, affected by Gharar. ■ Nullity of a contract which involves Gharar in any of its conditions origi nates from what has been discussed above about aleatory contracts.",

Preferably, the issuance of a reconciliation decision is to be based on a clear clause in the arbitration document indicating that arbitrators have the right to pursue reconciliation.

The arbitrators in this case shall concur to the request of the two parties, unless the proposed settlement is impermissible, or contrary to public order. Arbitration Document It is a document signed by the two parties to pursue arbitration on a dis pute which has arisen between them. Arbitration Agreement It is a prior condition or a contract stipulating resort to arbitration when dispute arises. Material Mistakes It refers to unintentional mistakes in names or numbers, when proofs or documents indicate the aspects which need correction. Institutional Arbitration It is the selection of an Institution that comprises competent arbitrators to resolve the dispute.

    "section_title": "Appendix (B)",
    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard ■ The basis for considering Waqf (in principle) as a permissible and re commendable practice (Mandub) is the Quranic Verses which instruct people to do good and spend on charitable causes, and also the Hadith (Prophetic tradition) which indicates: “When a person dies his rightful deeds will stop except in three respects: An ongoing charity “Sadaqah Ja riyah...”. Waqf is considered to be the ongoing charity referred to in the Hadith, because the beneficiary does not own the Waqf asset, and accor dingly, cannot dispose of it. Moreover, there is the Hadith about the piece of land in Khybar which Umar donated as Waqf, when the Prophet (peace be upon him) advised him to do so. Again, permissibility of Waqf is supported by the practice of the Sahabah (Prophet’s Companions) like Uthman and Abu Talhah, in addition to Ijma’ (consensus of Fuqaha). Waqf for charitable purposes can also be justified through Qiyas (analogical deduction) in comparison to Waqf justified through Qiyas (analogical deduction) in comparison to Waqf for mosques. Enforceability of the Waqf when it is indicated by a donor in his will, stems from the fact that according to Shari’ah a will should be executed, and its alteration or cancelation is strictly prohibited. ■ Family Waqf (Waqf ahli or Dhurri) is permissible on the basis of the Ha dith about Umar’s Waqf, and because family Waqf is, in fact, a charitable Waqf since it will finally become so. ■ Acceptance of the Waqf is not a condition for its validity when the beneficiary is not specified, because acceptance cannot be expected in this case. In case of a specific beneficiary, acceptance can be obtained from him even if implicitly when he keeps silent. The ruling that when the beneficiary rejects the Waqf his rights in the Waqf shall be dropped, whereas the Waqf should still remain valid, is based on the viewpoint of the Hanafi School of fiqh. The justification here is that the beneficiary can drop his own rights in the Waqf, but he cannot nullify the Waqf itself. ■ Waqf inception can be subject to any form of disposition which traditio nally indicates it, because traditions are usually recognizable, when they do not contradict with Shari’ah rulings. ■ Permissibility of temporary Waqf is based on the viewpoints of the Maliki and the Imami Schools of Fiqh, in addition to what has been reported about the viewpoint of Abu Yusuf of the Hanafi School. Such viewpoint is based on the fact that a temporary Waqf can also fulfill its charitable objectives and result in two benefits: one of them is the benefit generated from Waqf throughout its specified period, and the other is the benefit to the Waqif since he may need his property in the future. Moreover, permissibility of temporary Waqf could encourage Waqf practicing, and, hence, contribute to fulfillment of the present need for charitable institutions. ■ Permissibility of declaring Waqf as effective starting from a future date can be viewed in terms of analogy between Waqf and Wasiyyah (will). ■ The ruling that the Waqif should have full legal competence is based on the fact that Waqf in its very essence is a donation (Tabarru’), and there fore, the Waqif should have full legal competence. ■ Prohibition of Waqf by a person who is legally restricted for irrationality, aims at safeguarding his creditors, his own self, and his dependants. There aims at safeguarding his creditors, his own self, and his dependants. There is no harm, however, when the irrational person declares the Waqf for himself. As regards the Waqf by a person who is suffering a fatal illness, it should be subject to the rulings applicable to the will of such person. ■ Permissibility of retreating from Waqf, unless it is a mosque, is the Ha dith that has been narrated by Abdullah Ibn Umar and Umar’s Hadith, as well as Qiyas (analogical deduction) to ’Ariyah (a lent thing). well as Qiyas (analogical deduction) to ’Ariyah (a lent thing). ■ The basis of the ruling that Waqf should not be for an impermissible purpose while it can be for non-charitable purposes, is that Waqf is a donation (Tabarru’), and therefore, the only Shari’ah condition to be observed in it is permissibility of the purpose for which the donation is made. This viewpoint belongs to the Maliki School, whereas the Hanafi School is of the opinion that the Waqf purpose should be charitable. ■ The ruling that Waqf can be made for a person who is nonexistent at the time of establishing the Waqf, is based on the Hadiths narrated about Waqf for progeny, and on the fact that Waqf is an ongoing charity and therefore it should include those who will exist in the future. ■ Waqf is said to have a legal personality and financial liability which are quite independent from those of its superintendent, because Waqf can give and take commitments. When, for instance, the Waqf superintendent borrows money for the Waqf, the debt obligation does not fall on him but rather on the Waqf itself. Similarly, when the beneficiary fails to fulfill his obligation towards the Waqf, he becomes indebted to the Waqf, rather than to the Waqf superintendent. Therefore, in this case, the Waqf superintendent has no right to relief the debtor from the debt. ■ The ruling that Waqf donation should not exceed one third of the donor’s wealth, is based on the analogy between Waqf and Wasiyyah (will), where part of the wealth should be left to the inheritors of the deceased (the obligatory entitlement as per Shari’ah). This has been explicitly referred to in the Egyptian Law of Awqaf. ■ Permissibility of making Waqf in the form of moveable property, regardless of its nature and even if such property is not survivable, is based on the ruling practice during the era of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and the orthodox caliphs with respect to making Waqfs for mosques. The majority of Fiqh scholars also support this viewpoint; whereas the Hanafi scholars hold that Waqf of moveable property is permissible only when it is the normal practice. ■ Money can be donated as a Waqf because this is the original form of Waqf, as emphasized by Muhammad Ibn Abdullah Al-Ansari the companion of Imam Zafar and supported by Ibn Taymiyyah. Shares and Sukuk come under this type of Waqf. ■ A usufruct can be donated as Waqf, because it is wealth, and hence it should be subject to the general rules of Waqf. The fact that a usufruct is should be subject to the general rules of Waqf. The fact that a usufruct is temporary does not affect this ruling since Waqf can also be temporary as has been indicated earlier. ■ The ruling that permissible conditions of the Waqif shall be observed (including the ten conditions), is based on the Hadith which states: “Muslims are bound to the conditions they make”. In the last part of it, this Hadith implies that the donor’s condition which has to be observed should not be in contradiction with the Shari’ah “…except a condition that permits what has been prohibited or prohibits what has been permitted (by Shari’ah).” ■ The basis for appointing a superintendent for the Waqf is the Hadith which indicates that: “There is no misdemeanor (Junah) on the one who is in charge of it”, and because interest necessitates the presence of someone who takes care of the investments of the Waqf assets, collection of the Waqf’s income and distributing it among beneficiaries. ■ The Waqf superintendent has to observe the conditions of the Waqif be cause Waqf is a donation (Tabarru’), and therefore, it can be subject to conditions according to Shari’ah. As regards observation of the rules of Shari’ah, the reason is obvious. ■ The basis for depriving the Waqf superintendent the right of leasing the Waqf to himself or his son (without resorting to legal authorities) is the fear from favoritism which is part of human nature, and therefore prohibition of such leasing arrangement would minimize the chance for neglecting the interest of the Waqf. ■ The ruling that a Waqf property shall not be lent is based on the fact that lending the property will reduce the chances for its investment. ■ Borrowing for the Waqf is restricted to the case of acute need, and not allowed for spending on the beneficiaries, because borrowing is meant to safeguard the Waqf against the harm of being useless, whereas refraining from payment to beneficiaries when there is no Waqf income does not involve such harm. ■ Permissibility of combining Waqf resources is based on the fact that it could lead to the benefit of the Waqf, and that all Waqf properties are devoted for the Sake of Allah, Glory be to Him. However, appropriate allocation to the different beneficiaries of the combined Waqf assets should be duly observed so as not to cause harm to such beneficiaries. The General Council of Fatwa of Kuwait issued a Fatwa (Shari’ah opinion) permitting transference of the excess income of a mosque to other mosques. ■ The condition pertaining to the need for judiciary supervision on the Waqf is based on the desire to ensure the achievement of the interests of the stakeholders, and perform the role of Hisbah (a Shari’ah regulatory body). The first person who arranged judiciary supervision on the Waqf was Tawbah Ibn Namir, the judge of Egypt in the early Islamic era. ■ The ruling that Waqf assets should not be leased for less than the normal rent of similar assets (while minor injustice could be accepted) is based on the desire to avoid favoritism and waste of Waqf income. This viewpoint enjoys unanimous agreement of Muslim Fiqh scholars. The viewpoint regarding termination of the contract when the normal rent of similar property increases and the Waqf tenant refuses rent increment belongs to the Hanafi School, contrary to the Maliki and Shafi’i Schools who hold that the contract should not be terminated if the lease contract is for a specific period. ■ Permissibility of the forms of Waqf leasing which have been indicated in Fiqh references is based on the desire to preserve the interests of the Waqf as well as the interests of all its tenants, without causing injustice to any party or neglecting the interest of the Waqf property. ■ Permissibility of application of modern financing techniques which have been developed by Institutions rests on the fact that such forms are in conformity with the usual forms of land leasing and cultivation. Such modern forms could even generate more income than the traditional ones, and achieve the goals of preservation and security of the Waqf assets. ■ Permissibility of making a reserve fund for maintenance and renovation of the Waqf is based on the desire to preserve the Waqf assets and their ability to generate income, as has been emphasized by a number of Fiqh scholars. ■ Istibdal (exchange of the Waqf asset) is permissible because it achieves the interest of the Waqf, through its development and maximization of its income.",

The term Waqf is also used to describe the property donated in this manner. Waqf Ahli (Family Waqf) The income of the donated assets or usufructs goes in this case to the Waqif himself, his children, a certain number of people, or a specific entity, for a specific period. Waqf Khayri (Charitable Waqf) The income of the donated assets or usufructs goes to charitable purposes without specifying a certain entity or a specific group of people as beneficiaries. The Waqf could be eternal or temporary. Waqf Assets The property used for generating income, while it cannot be disposed of. Hikr or Tahkir A lease contract according to which the Waqf land is kept in the hands of the tenant to build on it or cultivate it as long as he pays the normal rent for such property. Hikr or Tahkir can also take place through utilization of the Waqf land by leasing it for a specific purpose without specifying the period, and thus, the tenant obtains the right to stay, subject to a valid contract. A third form of Hikr or Tahkir can take place implicitly when the land is leased for a specific period, and then the tenant build on it or cultivate it after obtaining the permission for that. In this latter case, when the lease period expires, and the tenant wishes to stay and pay the rent equivalent to that of similar property, he can be allowed to do so, in order not to cause harm to him. Hikr or Tahkir is an alternative to Istibdal (exchange of the Waqf land), when the latter is not possible. These two methods constitute a financial right which cannot be inherited. Irsad or Takhsis (Allocation) Irsad refers to the case when the government authorities allocate a pub licly owned piece of land for public utilities such as schools, hospitals and charitable activities. This is not considered as Waqf because, in this case, the land is allocated by someone who does not own it. Haq Al-Qrar (Right to Stay) Preference right to build on or cultivate the Waqf land. A certain type of this contractual arrangement is sometimes known as Kadak, and is applicable to leasing of shops and factories.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard ■ Hiring of persons is permissible according to Qur`an, Sunnah (Prophetic Traditions) and Ijma’ (consensus of Fuqaha). In Qur`an this is emphasized in the Verse stating: {“Then if they give suck to the children for you, give them their due payment”}. As far as Sunnah is concerned, permissibility of hiring of persons can be derived, for instance, from the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in which he said: “The most eligible of whatsoever you have got a pay for, is the Book of Allah”.(3) This in addition to many other Hadiths. In this regard, Al-Bukhari presented a whole chapter on Ijarah (hiring) which comprises 22 sections, and so did Abu Dawud, as well as other Sunnah scholars who referred to several Hadiths on the subject within other chapters. Similarly, Ijma’ (consensus of Fuqaha) on permissibility of hiring of persons is said to have been reached since the time of the Sahabah (companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him), as well as the time of their successors and the founding leaders of the schools of Fiqh. In this respect Al-Kasani said: “As regards Ijma’ of the Ummah (Muslim Nation) it had been reached before the existence of the deaf…….”.(4) ■ Permissibility of a pledge which is binding to only one party is supported by a number of Shari’ah proofs which support honoring of contracts, pledges and promises, in addition to what has been emphasized by some Shari’ah scholars. On this regard, the International Islamic Fiqh Academy issued its resolution No. 40-41 (2/5 & 3/5) on Enforceability of Pledge in Murabahah.(5) The rulings stated in that resolution also hold true in the case of pledge in hiring and other similar dispositions. ■ Permissibility for the institution to receive an amount from the party who pledges to hire its services (seriousness margin), is based on need and interest. A similar Fatwa (Shari’ah opinion) has been issued in this regard by the Unified Shari’ah Supervisory Board of Al Baraka Group.(6) That Fatwa is relevant to the case of hiring. ■ Enforceability of the hiring contract is derived from the verses and Hadiths which instruct people to honor contracts, as when Allah, the Almighty, says: {“O you who believe! Fulfill (your) obligations...”}.(7) besides the general consensus among fiqh scholars on enforceability of hiring,(8) since it is a contract which facilitates ownership through exchange of two objects. ■ The ruling that the period of hiring should be specified stems from the fact that non-specification could result in prohibited Gharar (uncertainty) and Jahalah (ignorance) which lead to dispute. Prohibition of sales which involve Gharar (uncertainty) has been emphasized by well verified Hadiths.(9) Therefore hiring of persons shall not involve Gharar, because, in essence, it is a sale of service/work. ■ Permissibility of hiring of persons for doing deferred services is based on the practice of the Prophet (peace be upon him) when he and Abu Bakr hired a man from Bani Al-Dail to serve them as a guide, after three days.(10) Moreover, hiring is a time-based contract and therefore its object can be delivered in the future. ■ Permissibility of taking ’Arboun (Earnest Money) is derived from what Omar did in the presence of Sahabah (companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him), and adopted by Ahmad. On this regard, The Islamic Fiqh Academy of Makkah Al-Mukarramah has also issued its resolution No. 72 (3/8). ■ Sub-hiring is permissible because when the employer owns the service/ work he becomes able to transfer it to someone else. ■ The ruling that a hiring contract can be conditional is based on the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him) which indicates: “Muslims are at their conditions, except a condition that permits what has been prohibited or prohibit what has been permitted.”(11) ■ The ruling that hiring for a specific service is impermissible before owning and possessing the service, is reached by analogy to prohibition of selling things that one does not own, and the Hadith which has been narrated by Hakim Ibn Hizam stating: “Don’t sell what you do not have”.(12) ■ Permissibility of signing a hiring contract for a service to be delivered in the future, is judged by analogy to Salam, and because that does not lead to dispute. According to the Shafi’i and Hanbali scholars the pay should not necessarily be made in advance. ■ A private employee should not guarantee what he works on, except in case of transgression, negligence, or breach of a condition. This is actually the general principle in trust-based contracts; in addition to that, the contract comprises an interest for the employee since he will receive the pay. In case of transgression, negligence, or breach of condition the act results in harm, and hence the employee has to indemnify the employer, as per the directives of the Prophet (peace be upon him) who said: “No harm, and no reciprocal harm”.(13) ■ The ruling that a shared employee has to guarantee what he works on, is based on what has been reported about some of the Sahabah (companions of the Prophet – peace be upon him) who emphasized that this has to be so, because the shared employee will be doing what he has been paid to do in the absence of the owner, besides the fact that the employee in this case is working for many employers rather than for a particular employer.(14) ■ The hired service shall be permissible because what is prohibited by Shari’ah cannot be an object of a Shari’ah-recognizable contract. Moreover, impermissible hiring entails provision of support to wrongdoing and misbehavior; whereas Allah, the Most High, says: {“Help you one another in Al-Birr and Al-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety, but do not help one another in sin and transgression”}.(15) ■ The pay for future hiring periods can be adjusted on mutual consent of the two parties, because such adjustment constitutes contract renewal for a coming period. No pay has yet become payable to the employee for that future period so that it can become a debt owed the employer, and consequently lead to prohibited rescheduling of debt. When, instead, such adjustment is done for an unsettled amount of pay which belongs to past periods, so as to extend the repayment period against an increase in the amount to be paid, adjustment in this case will lead to Riba (usury). The 11th Seminar of Al Baraka has already issued a Fatwa in this connection.(16) ■ The ruling that the pay can be composed of two parts is based on Tradi (mutual consent), in addition to the fact that such arrangement neither violates the contract rulings nor does it encounter a Shari’ah prohibition. ■ The pay can be in the form of a common share, because the pay in this form can be known, and will not lead to dispute or Gharar (uncertainty). ■ Permissibility of stipulating in the contract that all outstanding installments of the pay shall become due in case of default by the employer in the settlement of any installment is based on Tradi (mutual consent), besides the fact that such a condition neither violates the contract nor does it encounter Shari’ah prohibition. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Muslims are bound by the conditions the make”.(17) In this regard the International Islamic Fiqh Academy has also issued its resolution No. 64 (2/7).(18) ■ Impermissibility of stipulating a condition for increasing pay overdues is based on the fact that any increment in such amounts (against extension of settlement period) is Riba (usury). In this connection, The International Islamic Fiqh Academy issued its resolution No. 133 (7/14).(19) ■ Permissibility of applying two rates of pay (so that the employer would become entitled to the higher rate when he performs the work in the shorter period and vice versa) stems from the fact that such arrangement does not lead to Gharar (uncertainty) or Jahalah (ignorance). In addition to that, such arrangement had been Traditionally resorted to, and approved by a number of Fiqh scholars.(20) ■ Permissibility of seeking payment guarantees, is similar to permissibility of Kafalah (suretyship) and Tawthiqat (documentations) in Islamic juris prudence, besides the fact that request for guarantees here does not violate the rulings of the contract but rather confirms them, since guarantees are suitable for debt contracts. ■ The contract becomes null and void when the service is completely or partially useless, because the outcome of the contract has not been accomplished, and the contract has not achieved its objectives. In addition to all that, the pay is supposed to be made against the benefit. In this respect, the International Islamic Fiqh Academy issued its Resolution No. 13 (1/3).(21) If, instead, the contract relates to a specifically defined service which has to be delivered in the future, the contract does not become null and void because the service in question will still remain as a debt, and the employee should be asked to provide a service that has the same specifications. ■ The ruling that hiring will come to an end on expiry of the contract period or on the consent of the two parties, is based on the fact that a hiring contract is a time-based contract and therefore, it expires at the end of the period. Similarly, a hiring contract is a consensual contract which starts and ends on the consent of the two parties. ■ Permissibility of spontaneous renewal of the contract when it is stipulated Permissibility of spontaneous renewal of the contract when it is stipulated as a condition or when agreed upon between the two parties, stems from the fact that such condition does not violate the rulings of the contract. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Muslims are bound by the conditions the make”.(22) ■ The basis for the commitments of the employee and the employer is that such commitments constitute essential requisites of the contract for hiring of persons. Moreover, such commitments are based on the agreement of the two parties. Both of these two justifications are unanimously accepted by Shari’ah scholars.(23) ■ The ruling that a hiring contract which relates to the employee in person becomes null and void on the death, loss of legal competency or persistent sickness of the employee, is based on the fact that the object of contracting will, thus, become no longer existent. Consequently, there will also be no pay since the pay is to be made in exchange of the benefit. In addition to all that, this ruling conforms to normal practice. ■ The ruling that a contract which relates to a future service does not become null and void on the death of the employee, is based on the fact that in this case the service, as a debt, is considered as existent. ■ The pay shall become due even if the employer could not benefit from the employee who had put himself at his disposal. This ruling is based on the fact that the employee is entitled to the pay since he has been able to fulfill the condition of putting himself at the disposal of the employer, while the employer has no excuse for not benefiting from the services. ■ Permissibility of terminating the hiring contract in case of contingencies is based on observation of need and necessity of avoiding hardship, in addition to normal practice. A Fatwa in this regard has been issued by the Board of Fatwa and Shari’ah Supervision of the Kuwait Finance House.(24) ■ Permissibility for the employee to state a condition for termination of the contract when the pay is delayed is based on the fact that such condition is fair, and does not violate the rulings of the contract. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Muslims are at their conditions”.(25) (24) Fatwa No. (232) and No. (252). (25) Reference has been referred to earlier.",

This rule is adopted by the various schools of Fiqh with regard to external incidents which take place without the intervention of any of the two parties. ■ The ruling that the commitment shall become null and void if its fulfillment has become useless is based on the fact that implementation of a useless commitment is an act of futility, while there is no room for futility in Shari’ah legislation as indicated by Al-Shatibi and others. ■ The basis for the ruling that commitment shall become ineffective when the object of the contract turns out to be owned by someone else other than the committed party, is that unlawful seizure is unrecognizable as a basis of ownership. The Prophet (peace be upon him) is reported to have said: “An extorter is indebted with what he takes until he returns it back”.(2) ■ The basis for the rulings relating to Jawa`ih (calamities) is the Hadith(3) (Prophetic tradition) which states: “The Prophet (peace be upon him) has forbidden Bay’ al-Sinin (sale of agricultural produce for many years to come), and permitted value discounts on calamities” calamities”.. Therefore, rulings can be derived from this Hadith for similar cases when the object of the contract is lost due to an inevitable incident.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Shari’ah Basis for Charging a Fee for Preparation of the Credit Study The credit study is a detailed study on the financial and credit position of the client so as to facilitate assessment of his credit worthiness and ability to honor commitments. According to Shari’ah, this task as such can constitute a remunerable service apart from the financing contract. The institution can even stipulate a condition that the study should be prepared by a third party. Charging the client for the credit study is also justified by the fact that the benefit from the study is shared between the financier and the financed party, rather than confined to the former only. The fee for the study should not necessarily be equal to the actual cost of its preparation, since it is a service which can be performed independently within the contract. Therefore, the credit agreement fee is considered as a fee payable for the effort exerted in preparation of the study as an independent service, irrespective of its results. In this regard, the Shari’ah Board of Aayan Company for Leasing and Finance issued a Fatwa (Fatawa Aayan: 189), indicating permissibility of charging such fees. The text of that Fatwa runs as follows: “When the clients of Aayan Company wish to sign with Aayan Company permissible investment or financing contracts through Mudarabah, Musharakah or any other mode of financing, and if Aayan Company, for that purpose, needs to conduct a study on the financial status of these clients and their legal eligibility for concluding such contracts, it is permissible for Aayan Companyto sign special contracts with these clients so that Aayan Company prepares the required study. For preparation of the study, Aayan Company may charge a fee to be paid by the clients on the basis of the special contracts which should be completely separate from the financing and legal contracts pertaining to the deals in question. The prepared study should become the property of the client once he pays the cost of its preparation, and therefore Aayan Company should not deprive him the right of obtaining it. Aayan Company should handover the study to the client so that he can be able to use it in his deals with Aayan Company or with any other party”.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (C) Definitions Financing Financing takes place only when one of the two objects of the transaction is deferred such as loan, discounting of bills, simple credit, Murabahah, Salam and Istisna’a. Financing may not take place in suretyships suretyships,, letters of guarantee, letters of documentary credits and bank acceptances. Therefore, the term financing is more special than the term credit. That is to say, any financing is credit, but any credit does not always lead to financing. Indebted-Current This is one of the traditional forms of extending loans to customers. In this case the customer (borrower) is given access to draw from an account opened for this purpose (the indebted-current account) up to a certain maximum limit which constitutes the amount of the loan, and within a specific period. A maximum date will also be specified for repayment of the drawn amounts. Such account is usually made subject to the following terms: ■ The customer has to pay interest on the amounts he draws actually. ■ The customer should pay a commitment fee calculable as a percentage of the total amount of the loan. Such amount is paid in addition to interest and is considered as Riba (usury). The indebted-current account differs from the direct loan in that interest in the case of the former is paid at the end of the transaction’s period. In the indebted-current account also interest is calculable on the basis of the amounts that have been actually used by the customer (the debit balance). Facility Limits The maximum limit of the facility is the total amount of the facility that has been approved by the institution. Such amount is extended through a specific mode of financing (Murabahah, Ijarah, letter of guarantee, documentary credit ….etc.). It constitutes the maximum exposure limit for the institution with regard to the specific client. Credit Policy Credit policy refers to the precautionary measures adopted by the Institution with the aim of safeguarding its funds in the light of rules and regulations and in view of the resolutions of its Shari’ah Supervisory Board and the prevailing principles and traditions in the field of its activities. Credit Study The credit study is the process of identifying the credit worthiness of the client and his ability to honor his commitments within the specified period. It also aims to assess the suitability of the type, size and currency of the requested financing to the activity to be financed, and to what extent the financing is commensurate with the resources and capabilities of the client in general. Moreover, the credit study indicates - subject to the nature of financing operations - the suitable guarantees to be requested from the client, whether for the debts and entitlements stemming from the operations or against transgression and negligence from his part. The final result of the study presents a clear recommendation on whether the client is to be offered the facility subject to certain conditions, or his application should be rejected on the basis of specific reasons. The credit study covers the financial standing, cash flow, activity results, income, and expenses of the client. It also covers other various aspects such as past experience of the institution with the same client, image of the client, and his ability to manage his activity and stand any difficulties hemay encounter while practicing such activity. Facility Agreement This agreement is signed between the client who applies for the facility and the institution when the decision to offer the facility is issued. The agreement indicates the type and amount of the facility as well as the guarantees and profit margin, or profit sharing ratio in case of Musharakah in Islamic transactions. Such agreement is not considered to be binding for the client before entering into the actual contracts.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard ■ The basis for permissibility of launching commercial websites if such sites are free from impermissible practices is the fact that in principle, transactions in any form are allowed, unless they lead to commitment of an impermissible act. Moreover, launching of such sites serves the interests of a large number of people in this era, and thus, conforms to the underlying mission of Shari’ah. ■ Permissibility of concluding online financial contracts is due to the fact that such contracts do not involve any impermissible aspect. They carry no difference from traditional contracts except in that the means used for their conclusion is different. If, in principle, contracts as such are allowed as long as they observe the rules of transactions in Shari’ah, it is only natural that the means whereby these contracts are concluded become allowed as long as they conform to permissible rules of contracting. ■ Concluding online contracts through audio or audiovisual communication between the two parties is classified under the category of contracts concluded in the presence of the two parties, because in such online contracts both parties are in fact present at the same time, although not in the same place. Therefore, simultaneous presence of the two parties in terms of time, which constitutes the prerequisite meant by coincidence of presence,(2) is fulfilled at the time of exchanging offer and acceptance. In this connection the International Islamic Fiqh Academy issued a resolution about the Shari’ah ruling on concluding contracts through the modern means of communication. The text of the resolution is as follows: “If any two parties enter into a contract at the same time while they are in different places – this includes contracting through telephone and wireless devices – contracting between these two parties is considered as contracting between two present parties”.(3) Needless to say, there is no difference between contracting through a telephone call, and contracting through online voice communication. ■ When the contract is concluded through written communication, by e-mail, or through access to site, it shall be classified as a contract signed in the absence of the two parties. This ruling is based on the fact that exchange of offer and acceptance in this case takes place without simultaneous presence of the two parties. In this regard the Al Baraka Seminar on Islamic Economics issued a resolution stating that “According to Shari’ah, when an online contract is signed between two parties who are not in the same place, it is considered as a contract between two absent parties if neither of the two parties can hear the voice of the other. Consequently such contract should become subject to the Shari’ah rulings on message contracting”.(4) ■ The ruling that the offering party does not have the right to retreat from his offer within the period specified by the seller for validity of the offer is based on the viewpoint of some Maliki scholars who believe that if an offer is announced to be valid for a specific period it should remain valid throughout that period. This viewpoint has been emphasized by AlHattab quoting Abu Bakar Al-Arabi.(5) In this regard also The International Islamic Fiqh Academy issued a resolution emphasizing the following: “When the offering party issues a term-offer through these devices, he is committed to keep his offer during the specified period. He does not have the right to retreat from it.”(6) ■ When the offering party sends the electronic message through website or e-mail without indicating all the rights and commitments relating to the contract in question, or when he stipulates a condition that he should have the right of withdrawal even if the message is accepted, the message is not considered as an offer, because from a Shari’ah point of view an offer should be categorically obvious and cannot bear any other meaning. ■ The ruling that irrespective of the method of contracting an online contract is considered to be valid since the time when the other party accepts the offer and whether the offering party has come to know that or not, is based on the fact that Shari’ah scholars define contract as “the concordance of two wills”. Therefore as soon as the accepting party declares his consent concordance between the two wills takes place and the contract becomes valid.(8) A resolution issued in this regard by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy states: “When a contract is to be signed, through a written message or a messenger, between two absent parties who are not in the same place and neither of them can see or hear the other - a case which includes contracting through telex, fax and PC screens - the validity of such contract starts as soon as the concerned party receives and accepts the offer”.(9) ■ The ruling that possession in the strict Shari’ah sense takes place when the purchaser, after signing the contract, downloads the computer software or the data or any other good of this type from the website to his pc, is based on the fact that possession takes place actually and constructively when the sold object is released and disposition is facilitated for the buyer. Possession of objects differs according to the type of the object in question and how its possession is normally perceived. In this respect a resolution has been issued by the International Islamic Fiqh Academy regarding possession and its forms, especially the recent ones.(10) ■ Prohibition of trespassing commercial websites and data theft is derived from prohibition of all forms of encroaching upon rights of others because Allah, the Almighty, says: {“…but transgress not the limits. Truly, Allah likes not the transgressors.”}. } (11) Moreover, websites have financial worth, and are considered as private rights of their owners. Trespassing of such sites may result in financial harm for their owners. In this regard the International Islamic Fiqh Academy issued a resolution emphasizing prohibition of transgression against trade name, trade address, trademark and all other similar rights. ■ Acceptability of adopting the electronic signature as a means of verifying the identities of dealers if such means is recognizable by the prevailing rules and regulations is based on the need to avoid the harm that could arise from online forgery in the dealers’ identities. In addition to that, adopting electronic signature does not constitute an impermissible practice. In fact Shari’ah encourages the use of technological means to preserve peoples’ wealth, because preservation of wealth constitutes one of the main five aims ((Maqasid Maqasid)) of Shari’ah. ■ The ruling that when forgery or an error is committed with regard to the personality or characteristics of one of the two parties, the other party has the right to terminate the contract is based on the fact that such an incident can influence the consent of the deceived party. According to Shari’ah the consent of the two parties is the fundamental prerequisite of contracting. This fact has been emphasized by the majority of Shari’ah scholars.(13) ■ The ruling that the state has to assume control upon online adhesion contracts - which are characterized with launching of public offers, uniform details, imposed terms and conditions, provision of indispensable commodities or usufructs and monopoly of supply - is based on the general texts of Shari’ah which instruct people to avoid harm and achieve justice. ■ If a contract is concluded on the basis of describing the object sold, or depending on the fact that the buyer has previously seen the object, or on presentation of a model resembling the object; whereas at the time of delivery the sold object is found to be different, the buyer should have the option of terminating the contract for false description. This ruling is based on the need for preservation of the rights of the two parties of the contract, as has been emphasized by the majority of Fiqh scholars.",

    "section_title": "Appendix (B)",
    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Shari’ah Rulings on Mortgage (item 3) ■ Mortgage is permissible when the debt transaction takes place while the two parties are on travel because Allah, the Almighty, says: {“I And if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then let there be a pledge taken (mortgaging)…”}. (mortgaging)…”} (2) Mortgage is also permissible when the contracting parties are not on travel, because Anas is reported to have said: “The Prophet (peace be upon Him) mortgaged his armor plate to a Jew in Al-Madinah and took some barley from him to his family”. family”. In this regard Ibn Al-Mundhir said: “I do not know anyone, except Mujahid, who held a different interpretation for the Verse: {“...if you are on a journey ...etc”} ...etc”}.. Traveling (adds Ibn Al-Mundhir) is referred to in the Verse as the predominant case where mortgage is needed, since traveling parties would most probably be in lack of a scribe. Hence the verse, although it mentions traveling, it does not stipulate it as a condition for concluding mortgage contracts. Mortgage is also not obligatory, a fact which - to my knowledge - has encountered no dispute. The emphasis on mortgage in the Verse indicates guidance rather than obligation, because Allah, the Almighty, says: {“and if one of you deposits a thing on trust with another”} another”}.(3) ■ According to the Hanbali,(4) Hanafi(5) and Shafi’i scholars mortgage is valid and binding when it is stipulated as a condition in a sale contract. The Hanbali(6) scholars believe that it is one of the conditions that serve the interest of the contract, whereas the Hanafi scholars consider it as one of the conditions that suit and conform to the contract, since it entails contract documentation.(7) In elaborating their standpoint the Hanafi scholars indicate: “In Shari’ah, mortgage as well as price suretyship serve the purpose of debt documentation. Stipulating mortgage as a condition in the contract is just like stipulating a condition that relates to quality of the price, hence it is an explicit condition for what the contract implicitly aims at”.(8) Mortgage is one of the conditions needed when the deal is to be concluded with someone who insists on them. If a condition of this type is not fulfilled the concerned party will have the right of option. One of the cases that justify having the right of option, according to the Hanafi scholars, is “Refraining from honoring a valid condition like the mortgage condition or suretyship for an outstanding debt”. ■ Keeping the mortgaged asset in the hands of a notary is permissible. According to the Shafi’i scholars it is permissible “because the right belongs to the two parties, so they can agree on that”.(10) ■ According to the Hanbali School when the seller stipulates a condition that he shall keep the sold object until he receives the price, his condition is considered to be valid and observable. To the Hanbali scholars, such type of condition is neither part of the contract’s necessities nor does it serve the contract’s interest, yet it does not run counter to the contract’s objectives. Nonetheless, such condition (as perceived by the Hanbali scholars) entails some benefit for the seller or the buyer.(11) ■ The seller does not have the right to stipulate a condition that he shall retain the ownership of the sold commodity until he receives the price which is deferred for a certain period.(12) The seller does not have such right because he has willingly relinquished his right in spot payment of the price; therefore, he has no right to cancel the right of the other party (to get the sold commodity).(13) This viewpoint is adopted by the Hanbali School.(14) Rulings Relating to the Mortgaged Asset (item 3/2) ■ The mortgaged asset should be a Shari’ah-permissible property because the underlying objective is to sell this asset for settlement of the debt in case of default. Therefore if the mortgaged asset is an impermissible property of the mortgagor, it cannot be sold. In this regard the Hanafi scholars indicate that “Mortgage is for settlement of debt, and a Muslim cannot repay debts or get debts repaid to him in terms of Shari’ah-banned objects such as alcohol and swine”.(15) In “Al-Insaf ” the Hanbali viewpoint is indicated as follows: “It is permissible to mortgage any asset that can be sold”.(16) ■ The mortgaged asset can be a debt,(17) a cash amount,(18) a common property, a borrowed asset or a rented asset. ■ The mortgage is a trust in the hands of the mortgagee and is owned by the mortgagor. The mortgagor should bear all the expenses relating to maintenance of the proper state of the mortgage object including all necessary outlays such as feeding, clothing, safekeeping, veterinary services and the likes. In this regard, the Prophet (peace be upon him) is reported to have said: “The one who mortgages the asset should get its benefits and bear its expenses.” Since the mortgaged asset belongs to the mortgagor he should, therefore, bear its expenses as if it is still in his hands.(21) According to the Hanafi School “expenses of a mortgaged asset are of two types: the first type includes all the expenses which relate to maintenance of the proper state of the asset and its preservation against decay, and such expenses should be borne by the mortgagor. The second type comprises expenses such as those relating to safekeeping of the asset, or returning it back to mortgagor, or returning back part of it which has been damaged by an accident; and such expenses have to be borne by the mortgagee”. Furthermore, the Hanafi scholars indicate: “When the mortgagee without the permission of the competent authority bears the expenses that should have been borne by the mortgagor, he is considered to have done so in donation, whereas when he does so on permission of the competent authority he has the right of recourse on the mortgagor for repayment. Similarly, the mortgagor is considered as a donor when he bears the expenses that should have been borne by the mortgagee without the permission of the concerned authority, and should have the right of recourse on the mortgagee when he does so, on permission of the competent authority”. ■ The mortgagee does not have the right to make free of charge benefit from the mortgaged asset, because otherwise he will be committing Riba. Rulings Relating to the Debt for Which the Mortgage Is Signed (item 3/3) ■ The mortgage contract can be signed before, along with or after the debt contract. In this regard the Hanbali scholars indicate that “signing of the mortgage contract can be visualized in terms of three cases: it can take place after signing of the debt contract and in this case it is permissible as per the unanimous viewpoint of Fiqh scholars, because the debt is already there and it needs documentation. The second case is when the mortgaged contract is signed at the same time of signing the debt contract, as when – for instance – one party says to the other: I sell to you this garment of mine for ten dinars payable after a month provided that you mortgage to me your slave Saad, and the other party responses: I agree to that. The mortgage contract in this second case is also valid, according to Al-Shafi’i and Ashab Al-Ra`y, because it is needed. The third case is when the mortgage contract is signed before the debt contract, as when - for instance – one party says to the other: I mortgage this slave of mine to you against lending me ten dinars. In this third case the mortgage contract is invalid according to the prevailing view point of the Hanbali School, while Al-Shafi’i considers it to be valid. The proponents of the validity of the contract in this case include also Abu Al-Khattab, Malik and Abu Hanifah. It is argued that the mortgage contract in this case is a documentation of a valid right and therefore it can precede it, similar to the case of guarantee. A further justification given by Fiqh scholars in this connection is that the mortgage contract in this case is signed for something which will take place in the future, and therefore it is similar to a darak guarantee (guarantee against occurrence of third party claim on the asset)”.(23) Execution of the Mortgage (item 3/4) ■ Foreclosure: According to Hadith: “Mortgage should not be foreclosed from its owner who should get its benefit and bear its expenses” expenses”.. The meaning of this Hadith is that the failure of the mortgagor to redeem his mortgaged asset does not make the mortgagee entitled to that asset. This was, in fact, the practice during the Pre-Islamic period (Jahiliyyah) when the mortgagee used to seize the mortgaged asset in case of default.(24) Contemporary Applications of Mortgage ■ Holding the documents which represent the ownership of the goods as a mortgage is permissible, because possession of the documents is considered as possession of the goods themselves. The possessor of the documents will become authorized to dispose of the goods like an owner. ■ It is permissible to mortgage shares because shares represent a common share of Shari’ah-permissible assets (cash, tangible assets, usufructs, rights and debts – item 3/1 of Shari’ah Standard on Financial Papers). As shown in item (7) above, some of the Fiqh scholars indicate that mortgaging of common property is permissible. ■ It is permissible to mortgage Sukuk because, similar to shares, they represent common shares in Shari’ah-permissible assets (cash, debts, usufructs, tangible assets). The only difference between shares and Sukuk is that Sukuk can be a common share of only one type of these assets (cash, or debts or usufructs or tangible assets), [see Shari’ah Standard on Investment Sukuk]. As we have seen previously Fiqh scholars indicate that it is permissible to mortgage common property as well as cash, tangible assets and debts. Although there is no Shari’ah or Fiqh text that permits or prohibits mortgaging of usufructs, yet I can see no Shari’ah restriction against it, if such usufructs are Shari’ah-acceptable and their mortgaging could achieve the Shari’ah objective of “Preservation of rights and documentation of debts, through sale of the mortgaged asset and repayment of the debt in case of default”. Achievement of such objective appears to be possible through mortgaging of the Sukuk issued against usufructs of assets (in hand and with debtors). [see Shari’ah Standard on Investment Sukuk, 5/1/5/2] ■ Permissibility of freezing the balances of current accounts and the like as mortgages is based on the fact that this is similar to mortgaging of assets which are previously held under the guarantee of the mortgagee (assets in the hands of the mortgagee), which is permissible.(25) ■ It is permissible for the Institution to retain investment accounts and investment units as mortgage because this is considered as mortgaging of common property which is permissible as has been indicted earlier in this standard. Permissibility of such mortgages can also be based on the fact that an investment account or unit usually comprises cash, or assets, or debts, or most often a mixture of all that. As we have seen earlier mortgaging of any of these items is permissible. Furthermore, mortgaging of investment accounts and units can be seen as similar to mortgages that comprise a forgivable degree of gharar, due to the changing nature of real assets as a component of such accounts and units. As we have seen before, such mortgages are permissible according to the Maliki scholars who argue that “since the mortgagee has the right to lend his money without documentation, it is only logical that he can accept documentation with some Gharar. In the final analysis something is better than nothing”.(26) Moreover, it can be argued that the unknown aspects of the transaction are later on going to be known. Contemporary Applications of Debt Mortgaging ■ It is permissible to issue documentary credit for a client on guarantee of a debt owed to this client by a third party, and documented by a letter of credit, a guarantee, a receipt, a commercial paper, a bond, or Islamic Sukuk, because it is permissible to mortgage debt as we have seen earlier. ■ It is permissible to issue documentary credit to a client against another documentary credit (Back-to-back credit and transferable credit), because a documentary credit results in a debt owed by the bank to the client, and such debt can be mortgaged for obtaining a new debt. Insurance of the Mortgaged Asset ■ Insurance of the mortgaged asset is permissible because if such asset is damaged the compensation received can be used for replacing the mortgage; and thus continuation of the vital role of mortgage in preservation of rights, documentation of debts and facilitation of debt repayment and collection is ensured.",

The holders of such accounts delegate the institution to invest their funds through Mudarabah. Investment accounts can be divided into two types. The first type is investment accounts that are managed on the basis of unrestricted Mudarabah where the Mudarib is delegated to invest the Mudarabah funds in any field of investment he deems suitable. The second type is investment accounts which are managed on the basis of restricted Mudarabah, where the Mudarib has to invest the Mudarabah funds in a specific type of investment to be determined by Rab al-Mal (owner of the capital). The relationship between the holders of these accounts and the institution is the typical relationship between the Mudarib (the work provider) and Rab alMal.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard ■ The current account is considered as a loan because the bank has to guarantee its repayment on demand. In this regard the International Islamic Fiqh Academy issued its resolution No. 86 (9/3) which stipulates that “Demand deposits (current accounts) whether in Islamic or traditional banks are loans in the strict Shari’ah sense. The receiving bank holds such deposits under guarantee and is committed by Shari’ah to repay them on demand. The fact that the receiving bank is solvent does not affect this ruling” Rulings and Conditions relating to Profit ■ Profit has to be known because it constitutes the object of contracting, and therefore ignorance about it nullifies the contract. ■ It is impermissible in Mudarabah to specify the return for any of the two parties in terms of a lump sum amount or a certain percentage of the capital, because such specification eliminates profit sharing which constitutes a fundamental aspect of the Mudarabah contract. By such specification, the very essence of partnership will be lost when, for instance, the profit earned is just equal to the lump sum amount or percentage of the capital earmarked for one party. ■ Permissibility of applying the scoring method of profit distribution is based on the fact that the funds of the participants in the same investment base have all contributed to achievement of the return as per their respective amounts and periods of stay in the accounts. The scoring method is the most equitable method of accounting in hand that can be used for assigning profit shares commensurate to the amounts and their periods of stay in the accounts. However, entering into investment on such basis necessitates mutual relief from commitments (Mubara’ah) among investors with regard to any part of entitlement that could not be catered for through this method. It is a well established principle in Figh literature that much more exemptions can be allowed in partnership-based dealings (Musharakat Musharakat)) than in exchange-based dealings (Mu’awadah) and that division (Qismah) through approximation of shares is based on mutual consent. ■ Charging the Mudarabah expenses in the way shown in the Standard takes into consideration what should be done by the Mudarib for the sake of carrying out his investment decisions on receipt of the funds, and his commitment to do the work which entails having the bodies required for that purpose. A resolution to this effect has also been issued by the Al Baraka Seminar (4/1). ■ Impermissibility of charging interest for loans is based on the fact that such charge constitutes Riba. In this regard the international Islamic Fiqh Academy issued its resolution No. (10/2) stipulating that “whether such increment is charged for postponement of a defaulted debt, or as an interest on the loan stipulated since the time of signing the contract, both increments are forms of Shari’ah-prohibited Riba”. ■ Impermissibility of postponing specification of profit ratios for the two Mudarabah parties until the profit is earned is based on the fact that such postponement leads to Jahalah (ignorance) which could lead to dispute. On the contrary, agreement between the two parties - at time of distribution - on changing the ratios agreed upon or donating part of the profit is a right that the two parties may permissibly exercise. ■ Impermissibility of final distribution of the profit between the stakeholders of the company before deduction of expenses, allocations and reserves is the Shari’ah principle that no profit is to be sought before preservation of the capital. ■ Permissibility of distributing the profit on the basis of constructive liquidation and after ensuring the safety of the capital is based on acceptance of valuation in Shari’ah(4) in several applications including Zakah as well as theft incidents. In this context, the Prophet (peace be upon him) is reported to have said: “When someone liberates a slave he owns with other parties, he should pay partners from his money, and if he has no money, the slave has to be equitably valued for him”. (5) ■ The Shari’ah basis for the ruling that no profit has to be sought in Mudarabah before preservation of the capital is the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him) who said: “A prayer performer is just like a merchant who obtains profit only after preserving his capital. Similarly a prayer performer cannot get his Nafilah (voluntary prayer) accepted before he performs Faridah (obligatory prayer)”.(6) This Hadith indicates that profit sharing is inacceptable before preservation of the capital. This is so because profit is an increment which cannot be obtained before obtaining the principal. ■ The Mudarabah contract becomes null and void when the two parties refrain from specifying profit sharing ratios and fail to find any established normal practice of profit sharing applicable to their case. This ruling is based on the fact that ignorance about profit, which constitutes the contracting object, must nullify the contract. ■ Profit sharing ratios can be commensurate to shareholding ratios or not, because profit is deserved for contribution of funds, work or guarantee. When any of these three aspects is fulfilled there is no Shari’ah prohibition for the partners to specify profit sharing ratios on mutual consent. This viewpoint is adopted in the Hanbali School.(7) ■ The Shari’ah basis for impermissibility of agreement between the two parties on charging the whole loss to one of them or using disproportionate ratios for loss distribution is the statement of Ali Ibn Abu Talib who is reported to have said: “Profit is to be distributed as per the agreement of the two parties, whereas loss should be borne according to the ratios of contribution to the capital”.(8) A condition which stipulates that the loss of one party should be borne by the other party is invalid because it is oppressive and would lead to reaping of unlawful gain by one party at the expense of the other. ■ It is permissible for the two parties to stipulate a condition that when profit exceeds certain limit or index the whole additional amount should be taken by one of them, because such condition is permissible according to Shari’ah if it happens to be stipulated. ■ It is impermissible to agree on earmarking the profit of a specific portion of the capital for one party and the profit of the remaining portion for the other, because such arrangement could jeopardize the process of profit sharing and lead to oppression. ■ Permissibility of agreement between the two parties to change profit sharing ratios at any time, stems from the fact that the two parties are the sole owners of the profit, and agreement between them to change its distribution ratios does not entail a Shari’ah-prohibited act, such as discarding away the principle of profit sharing.(9) ■ Permissibility of agreement on fixed or variable ratios of profit distribution is based on the validity of such agreement since it has been the result of mutual consent. The only restriction is that such agreement should observe the Shari’ah ruling that neither of the two parties should be deprived from his share in the profit. ■ Regarding constructive liquidation a resolution has been issued by the Islamic Fiqh Academy of Makkah Al-Mukarramah.",

    "section_title": "Appendix (B)",
    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard ■ Impermissibility of commercial reinsurance is based on the fact that the idea of commercial reinsurance depends on the idea of commercial insurance and involves Shari’ah-prohibited Gharar. As related by Muslim, Ashab al-Sunan and others, quoting Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibited Bay’ al-Gharar(2) (aleatory sale). Gharar, as defined by several Fiqh scholars, indicates uncertainty about the outcomes, or the consequences, or end result of something.(3) According to some contemporary Fiqh scholars Gharar is similar to or part of betting or gambling.(4) A number of resolutions on prohibition of Gharar have also been issued by Islamic Fiqh Academies including the Resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Academy -Makkah Al-Mukarramah in its 1398 A.H. Session, endorsing the Resolution of the Supreme Council of the Ulema of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in its 10th Session held in Riyadh on 4 Rabi’ II, 1397 A.H., and Resolution No. (9) 9/1 of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy. ■ Permissibility of cooperative insurance stems from the fact that cooperative insurance companies are based on cooperation and donation rather than on exchange-based dealings. It is a well-known as Fiqh axiom that Gharar does not affect donation-based contracts. Permissibility of cooperative insurance can also be derived from several Verses of the Glorious Qur’an and Prophetic Hadiths which instruct people to cooperate. In this regard, a number of resolutions have been issued by the Islamic Research Academy of Al-Azhar in addition to the Resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Academy -Makkah Al-Mukarramah and Resolution No. (9) 9/1 of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy which states: “Indeed, the contract which respects the origins of Islamic dealings is the cooperative insurance contract which is based on donation and cooperation…” Moreover, permissibility of cooperative insurance contract has never encountered dispute from any contemporary Fiqh scholar.(5) In addition to what has been stated above, the underlying reasons for permissibility of solidarity reinsurance and impermissibility of commercial reinsurance can be summarized in the following essential differences between the two systems: a) The commercial reinsurance company is an exchange-based financial contract which aims to make profit out of the reinsurance itself, and therefore should become subject to the rulings on exchange-based financial contracts which can be affected by Gharar. In the contrary, in solidarity reinsurance the contract is based on donation and cooperation and thus cannot be affected by Gharar when the contract involves it. b) The company in the Islamic reinsurance contract is an agent of the reinsurance account, whereas in commercial reinsurance the company is a principal party who signs the contract in his own name. c) The company in commercial reinsurance owns the reinsurance premiums against commitment to pay the reinsurance amount, while in Islamic reinsurance the company does not own the contributions, which are owned by the reinsurance account. d) In Islamic reinsurance the remaining part of the contributions and the returns on it -after expenses and compensations- go to the account of the policyholders (such amounts represent the surplus distributed among participants), whereas this cannot be imagined in commercial reinsurance, because the contributions are owned by the company by virtue of the contract and through actual possession. The contributions in the case of commercial reinsurance are even considered as revenue and profit. e) In Islamic reinsurance the returns earned from investment of the principal amount of the contributions go to the account of the policyholder after deduction of the Mudarib’s share by the company, whereas in commercial reinsurance such returns go to the company. f) Islamic reinsurance aims to achieve cooperation among the participating companies rather than profit, whereas commercial reinsurance aims to achieve profit from the reinsurance process itself. g) In Islamic reinsurance the company makes profits by investment of its funds in addition to its share in the Mudarabah, as it assumes the role of the Mudarib and the reinsurance account assumes the role of Rab al-Mal. h) In Islamic reinsurance companies the participant and the reinsurance client are in fact the same person even if legally considered as separate personalities, while in commercial reinsurance companies they are completely different. i) An Islamic reinsurance company observes the rules of the Islamic Shari’ah and the Fatwas issued by its Shari’ah Supervisory Board, whereas the case is not so for commercial reinsurance companies. j) When the allocations deducted from the solidarity reinsurance fund remain unpaid until the time of liquidation they are spent on charitable purposes and are not given to the participants, whereas in commercial reinsurance companies such funds go to participants. ■ The Islamic reinsurance contract is considered as a binding donation contract, because it is analogous to Munahadah (contribution of travelers to a pool of food victuals) or to pledge of donation. Both of the Islamic Fiqh Academy of the Muslim World League and the International Islamic Fiqh Academy stipulated in their resolutions referred to earlier that Islamic reinsurance is based on donation. The fact that the Islamic reinsurance contract is binding can also be derived from what has been emphasized by Imam Malik about donation. According to Imam Malik a gift in general becomes valid before possession, and this was also said to have been the viewpoint of Ali and Ibn Masood. The Hanbali scholars hold that a gift is binding even if it is not possessed, except in things that are measured in terms of volume and weight.(6) Ibn Rushd (the grandson) said: “Scholars were in disagreement regarding possession…Malik said: “The contract is valid on acceptance, and possession of the gift should be enforced quite like the case in sale…”(7) Ali and Ibn Mas’ud are reported to have said: “Gift is permissible if it is known, whether it is possessed or not”. It is also reported that Abu Bakar and Omar considered the gift to be binding only when it is possessed.(8) Therefore, Malik seems to have taken all these viewpoints into consideration. He derived from the viewpoint of Ali, Ibn Masood and the others that the contract as such is binding, whereas he took the viewpoint of Abu Bakar and Omar to mean that possession is a necessary condition for completion of the contract so as to leave no room for the Dhari’ah (excuse) mentioned by Umar.(9) The fact that a pledge of donation is binding can also be derived from the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him) who said: “The person who retreats from a gift that he offers is like the dog which licks up its vomit” vomit”.(10) ■ The ruling that the company, which assumes the role of the agent in Islamic reinsurance, should not guarantee is based on the unanimous agreement among Fiqh scholars that an agent should not guarantee except in case of transgression, negligence or breach of the contract. ■ The necessity of mentioning the nine principles of Islamic reinsurance in the articles of association of the company stems from the need for reinforcing the donative nature of the contract and laying the Shari’ah foundation for this important aspect of the company. In the absence of emphasis on these principles which distinguish Islamic reinsurance from commercial reinsurance, Islamic reinsurance may become an exchange-based reinsurance contract, and hence becomes vulnerable to nullification by Gharar, as has been indicated earlier. For illustration of these distinguishing principles of Islamic reinsurance, several Fatwas have been issued including: Fatwa No. (12/11) issued by the 12th Al Baraka Seminar on Islamic Economics, and Fatwa No. (42/3) issued by the Shari’ah Supervisory Board of Al Rajhi Company, as well as the Fatwas of the Shari’ah Supervisory Board of Faisal Islamic Bank, Islamic Insurance company –Jordan-(11) and Islamic Insurance Company of Qatar. ■ The basic elements and conditions of the Islamic reinsurance contract are derived from its nature as a contract which is binding to the two parties in addition to the special nature of the insurance contract with regard to the subject matter of insurance. ■ The reinsurer and the client should honor their commitments because the reinsurance contract is binding to both parties. According to Shari’ah, the two parties should honor what they agree upon as long as it does not contradict with the rules and principles of Islamic Shari’ah. This can be derived from the Quranic Verses and Hadiths which instruct people to observe commitments and conditions they agree upon, including the Verse: {“O you who believe! Fulfill (your) obligations”}(12) and the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him) who said: “Muslims are at their conditions”. ■ The basis of the ruling that the reinsurance company may assume the responsibility of managing the reinsurance account against a fee or free of charge is the nature of the agency (Wakalah) contract which Fiqh scholars unanimously declare as permissible with or without remuneration. This point of view is supported by the 12th Al Baraka Seminar on Islamic Economics (Fatwa No. 12/11), the Islamic Fiqh Academy of the Muslim World League (Fatwa No. 961) and the Supreme Council of Ulama of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Fatwa No. 51). ■ Permissibility for the company to invest the funds of the reinsurance account is based on the Mudarabah contract which Fiqh scholars unanimously declare as permissible. Such contract entails prior specification of profit sharing ratios so that the reinsurance account can get its share of the profit as indicated by a number of Fatwas including: Fatwa of the Shari’ah Supervisory Board of Faisal Islamic Bank,(14) Fatwa No. 12/11 of the 12th Seminar of Al Baraka and Shari’ah Standard No. (13) on Mudarabah. ■ Necessity of observing conditions in general, including commitment of the company to present Qard Hasan (benevolent loan) to the reinsurance account, is based on the commitment to honor pledges that are binding to only one party of the contract. Honoring such pledges is emphasized by a number of distinguished Fiqh scholars, and is well supported by Shari’ah Texts and Traditions. One of these texts is the Verse: {“O you who believe! Fulfill (your) obligations”}, obligations”}, which is taken to mean any Shari’ah-acceptable commitment. Several Hadiths have also indicated enforceability of honoring contracts, pledges and promises.(15) In this respect also Fiqh Academies and Shari’ah Supervisory Boards have issued resolutions including: Resolution No. (40-41) 2-3/5(16) of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy, and the Fatwa of the Shari’ah Supervisory Board of the Islamic Insurance Company –Jordan.(17) ■ The ruling that the participant should bear the burden of proving, is based on application of the general rules of evidence which state that evidence is to be provided by the alleger. This rule is supported by explicit indications from the Qur`an and the Sunnah and the viewpoints of knowledgeable Fiqh scholars. A Fatwa in this regard has also been issued by the consolidated Shari’ah Supervisory Board of Al Baraka (Fatwa No. 14/6). ■ The basis of permissibility of the two types of reinsurance is the various evidences of permissibility of insurance and the Fatwas issued by the 2nd Seminar of Al Baraka (Fatwa No. 2/9), the 10th Seminar of Al Baraka (Fatwa No. 10/3/5), and the Fatwas of the Shari’ah Supervisory Boards of Dubai Islamic Bank, Faisal Islamic Bank, Kuwait Finance House, Qatar Islamic Bank and the Islamic Insurance Company.(18) ■ The basis of the rulings relating to the Islamic insurance and reinsurance contract is the general principles of contracts in the Islamic Shari’ah such as forbiddance of cheating and fraud, and necessity of commitment to the time specified for implementation of contracts. In addition to these general principles, the insurance and reinsurance contracts are also based on specific rulings pertaining to insurance coverage indicated by the Resolutions and Fatwas issued by the Islamic Fiqh Academy of the Muslim World League, the Supreme Council of Ulema and the Shari’ah Supervisory Boards of Islamic banks and Islamic insurance companies.(19) ■ The jurisdictions of the company are based on its articles of association, the documents which regulate the contract, the general principles of contracts and conditions, insurance practices and the Fatwas issued by Shari’ah Supervisory Boards.(20) ■ The rulings that relate to regulation of the relationship between the company and the policyholders are based on the articles of association of the company which specify whether the contract is a fee-based agency or not, in addition to the Mudarabah contract regarding the reinsurance fund. ■ The reinsurance coverage is based on the general texts affirming the Hadith which states: “No harm and no reciprocal harm”(21) and the general rules and principles of Islamic Fiqh which stipulate that coverage should be for the actual harms and not at all for making a wealth out of it. The reinsurance coverage is also governed by the donative nature of the Islamic reinsurance contract and the Fatwas issued by competent bodies such as Fatwa No. (3) of the 10th Seminar of Al Baraka and the Fatwas issued by the Shari’ah Supervisory Boards of Islamic banks and insurance companies. ■ The reinsurance surplus is based on the nature of the donation-based contract and what has been reported by Al-Bukhari about the practice of the Sahabah (companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him) in the case of Munahadah.(23) ■ Permissibility of reinsurance with traditional reinsurance companies is based on the practical necessity arising from lack for Islamic reinsurance coverage and the dire public need which ranks up as necessity. Shari’ah recognition for necessity and dire public need is supported by a number of Texts in the Qur`an and the Sunnah. In this respect also a Fatwa has been issued by Faisal Islamic Bank of Sudan (Fatwa No. 5/3).",

The insurance company, therefore, undertakes to pay to the reinsurance company part of the insurance premium paid by the participants, against commitment of the reinsurance company to bear part of the claims as per an agreement between the two parties. Islamic reinsurance has the distinctive characteristic of being based on the same principles of solidarity insurance, as indicated in Shari’ah Standard No. (26) on Islamic Insurance. Special Need Something that concerns a certain group of people, or the employees of a certain profession, as for instance the need for insurance for the employees in trade and industry sectors. Public Need Something that does not concern a certain group of people, or a certain country. Public need is the need that concerns everybody such as the need for Istisna’a. Reinsurance Commission A percentage amount of the contributions payable to the reinsurance company, paid to the Islamic insurance company for the efforts it exerts in mobilizing the reinsured insurance contracts. Reinsurance Profit Commission A percentage amount of the realized increase of revenues over expenses in the reinsurance agreement, paid to the Islamic insurance company as a bonus for its excellent performance in managing the insurance operations in general, and the reinsured risks in particular. Risk-Sharing Reinsurance The process of sharing the insured risk between the Islamic insurance  company and other insurance companies, either due to lack of sufficient insurance capacity for such risk, or because of regulatory requirements of risk sharing with regard to the magnitude of the risk in question. Financial Gains of Islamic Insurance Companies from Traditional Reinsurance Companies Reinsurance agreements between traditional reinsurance companies and Islamic insurance companies lead to the following financial gains to Islamic insurance companies: ■ Compensations for harms; the reinsurance company bears a percentage of the risk cover -when the harm materializes- commensurate to the percentage of its share from insurance contributions. ■ Reinsurance commission; which is a percentage amount of the contributions payable to the reinsurance company, paid to the Islamic insurance company for the efforts it exerts in mobilizing the reinsured insurance contracts. ■ Reinsurance profit commission; which refers to a percentage amount of the realized increase of revenues (reinsurance contributions) over expenses in the reinsurance agreement (coverage), paid to the Islamic insurance company as a bonus for its excellent performance in managing the insurance operations in general and the reinsured risks in particular, and providing the best services to its customers. Such amount is paid in the form of an agreed upon percentage of the profits of the reinsurance company, as per the reinsurance agreement signed between the two companies. When the reinsurance company earns profits from the reinsurance contracts signed between the two companies, the reinsurance company pays the part of the profits agreed upon to the insurance company.",

The insurance company agrees with the reinsurance company on signing annual agreements with the aim of transferring part of the risk borne by the insurance company, to the reinsurance company. 2. The insurance company assumes beforehand commitment to transfer to the reinsurer the agreed upon part of the reinsured risk, and the reinsurer offers his acceptance. According to the conditions of the reinsurance agreements, the commitment of the reinsurer becomes valid since the time of signing the original insurance contract with the insurance client. 3. The insurance company assumes the commitment to pay the reinsurance contribution against the commitment of the reinsurer to pay its share of the claims, in addition to the commissions agreed upon for the contracts within the signed agreements. It can also be stipulated in the agreement that the insurance company shall obtain a share in the profits achieved by the reinsurer under the signed agreements. 4. The insurance company retains a percentage of the reinsurance contributions (40%) for fire agreements, general accidents and marine and health insurance, as a guarantee for honoring commitments from the side of the reinsurer. The amount thus retained is to be released after one year within the reinsurance agreement. During the period of its retention, the amount is to be invested with the Islamic Bank of Jordan through Shari’ah-acceptable modes of investment, and the reinsurer be given the part of the return agreed upon. 5. The return thus obtained by the reinsurer becomes part of his accounts, and is deductable from the commissions to be received from him, on the basis of the fact that such amount is part of the cost of the reinsurance operation. 6. The reinsurer assumes the commitment to pay commission to the insurance company. Such commission is determined as a certain percentage of the reinsurance contributions. This amount does not represent a commission in the strict sense of the word. It is rather a contribution from the part of the reinsurer in the direct expenses borne by the insurance company, and which relate to the reinsured risks. 7. Such commissions enter into the accounts of policyholders as part of revenues in the account of the cooperative insurance fund. 8. The reinsurance agreement normally stipulates the right of the insurance company to obtain a specific percentage of the net profits achieved by the reinsurer under the reinsurance agreement. 9. Reinsurance profit commission is calculated at the end of the agreement period, and enters into the accounts of the policyholders as part of revenues.",

In long-term lease contracts, contrary to contractual terms that are based on what is permitted by the laws of some jurisdictions, the Shari’ah does not permit the tenant to sub-lease or assign the property to another tenant in return for payment except with the agreement of the owner. If the incumbent tenant agrees to hand over occupancy to a new tenant after the end of the lease period, the Shari’ah does not permit him to take any payment because the right of the incumbent tenant in the usufruct has expired.",

    "section_title": "Appendix (B)",
    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard ■ The basis for the recognition of financial rights is recognised jurisprudential evidences from the Qur`an, Sunnah, Ijma’ and Qiyas that indicate the right of ownership. ■ The basis for the rules governing rights to intangible assets is the Resolution of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy No. (43) 5/5 affirming, from established proofs, their existence and the rules governing them, which are the basis for the resolution. ■ The basis for the distinction between proprietary rights and personal rights is the view of contemporary jurists that Islamic jurisprudence has recognised this distinction in all matters that require such distinction. ■ The basis for the recognition of rights, whether to tangible or intangible assets is the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “No harm and no reciprocal harm” harm”. ■ The basis for the right of Shuf ’a enjoyed by a partner or a neighbour is the practice of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Jabir Ibn Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated: “Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) ruled in favor of the right of Shuf ’ah so long as the property is not divided” divided”. Abu Salamah Ibn Abdul-Rahman narrated: “The Prophet (peace be upon him) ruled in favor of the right of Shuf ’ah in property that has not been divided among the partners. If boundaries have been assigned between them and the paths have been demarcated, then there is no right of Shuf ’ah” h”. In the narration related by Muslim: “The Prophet (peace be upon him) ruled in favor of the right of Shuf ’ah in any undivided co-ownership, whether in a piece of land or an orchard. A co-owner is not allowed to sell his share unless permitted by the other co-owners. If the co-owner wants, he can buy it. If he wants, he can leave it. But if one co-owner sells it without permission of the other co-owners, then they have a greater right to it”. it”. Qatadah narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “The neighbour of the house has a greater right to the house” house”. These two Hadiths are reconciled by ascribing the last Hadith to a neighbour who is also a co-owner or shares easement rights. ■ The basis for the right to a share of water is Allah’s Statement in the Qur`an: {“Here is a she-camel: It has a right to drink (water), and you have a right to drink (water), (each) on a day, known”}. known”}. There is also Allah’s Statement in the Qur`an: “And inform them that the water is to be shared between them. Each one should drink in turn”. In Shari’ah, it means a turn to utilise water for land or trees or crops. Related Shari’ah terms are the right of Shirb, which is specifically for watering crops and trees; the right of Shafah, which is specifically the right of humans and animals to drink as well as using water for purposes like ablution, bathing, etc. There is a special set of rules for water in the Shari’ah based upon the statement of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “People share in three things: water, pasturage and fire” fire”. ■ The basis for the right of Tahjir and the rights established by first use is the Sunnah. Ibn Qudamah states: “Anyone who carries out Tahjir of previously unappropriated land and begins to make it productive but did not complete it, he is more entitled to it than others, based upon the statement of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Anyone who first uses what no other Muslim has previously used is more entitled to it” it”.. If he transfers it to someone else, then the second person is more entitled to it than others because the first owner of the right has granted it to him. If the owner of the right dies, it transfers to his heirs, based on the statement of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “The heirs of a deceased person inherit his estate”.. However, it is not permitted for the owner of a right of Tahjir to estate” sell it because his entitlement is confined to his personal use like the right of Shuf ’ah (preemption). [An alternative view is that] its sale could be considered valid because he is more entitled to it.(12) Al-Mardawi states: “Anyone carrying out Tahjir over previously unappropriated land will not own it…but he is more entitled to it than others, as well as his heirs after him and whomever he transfers it to, without any dispute. However, he cannot sell it, and this is the position of our School. It has also been said that he may sell it. Abu Khattab mentioned it as a possibility, and he referred to its permissibility as the correct position without any qualification in “Al-Muharrar” “Al-Muharrar”,, “Al-Ri’ayatayn” and “Al-Hawi Al-Saghir”. Al-Saghir” (13) ■ The basis for the prohibition of abusive exercise of rights is deduction from the Qur`an and Sunnah. There are many Verses in the Qur`an which indicate the obligation of justice, fairness and refraining from exercising one’s rights in a way that harms others. Allah commands: {“Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish”}. foolish”} (14) As for the Sunnah, we find the following Hadith: “May Allah bless the person who is lenient in selling and buying and when demanding his right”. right” ■ The basis for the invalidity of a condition stipulating that the seller retains ownership in a sale contract is that the transfer of ownership is a legal effect of the sale contract. Therefore, it is not permissible for a sale to take place without it. This has also been stressed in Resolution No. (51) 6/2 of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy held in Jeddah, which states: “The seller is not entitled to retain ownership of the sold item after the sale, but it is permissible for him to stipulate a condition on the buyer to retain possession of the item as security against deferred installments.” ■ The basis for the right of retention is the Qur`an and Sunnah. As for the Qur`an, it is stated by Allah: “And if you punish, then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflected. But if you endure patiently, verily, it is better for those who are patient” patient”.(15) The Glorious Verse indicates the permissibility of reciprocal treatment. Based on this, it is permissible for a person to retain his property unless he receives his own rights from others. As for the Sunnah, it was narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “The best amongst you is the one who is best in settlement of his obligations” obligations”.(16) ■ The basis for the impermissibility of taking consideration for sale or transfer of put or call options is Resolution No. (63) 7/1 of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy, which is based on recognised evidences. ■ The basis for the impermissibility of selling the abstract rights mentioned in item 10 is the lack of monetary value [according to Shari’ah] as well as the presence of Gharar (uncertainty)and Jahalah (ambiguity).",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (C) Definitions Right of Easement It is the established right over one piece of real estate for the benefit of another piece of real estate. Right of Irrigation (Shirb) Shirb literally means a share in water. The Shari’ah definition is a turn to irrigate land or trees or crops. Right of Watercourse (Majra) It is the right of an owner of land distant from a watercourse to bring it via the property of his neighbour to his land to irrigate it. Right of Drainage (Masil) It is the right of a person to get rid of excess water in his property via the property of another person. Watercourse is different from drainage in that watercourse is in order to bring water whereas drainage is to get rid of water not needed for the land. Right of Way Easement (Murur) It is the right of the owner of an interior piece of land (land surrounded by other persons’ lands) to access his land by means of a road/path. It makes no difference if the road/path is public, not owned by anyone, or is privately owned by someone. Right of Ascendancy (Ta’alli) The right of ascendancy means one person’s right to have his structure be physically located above the structure of another person. This happens in multi- storey buildings in which one person owns a unit in a lower storey and another owns a unit in the storey above it. Preemption Preemption in the terminology of jurists means the entitlement of the partner to buy what his partner has sold for the price at which he sold it. Intangible Rights Intangible right is the authority of a person over something that is abstract, e.g., ideas and inventions. The International Islamic Fiqh Academy, headquartered in Jeddah, issued its Resolution No. (43) 5/5 on the subject of intangible rights, which include; Trade Name, Title, Trademark, Authorship, and Invention. The Academy considered these to be rights particular to their respective owners which have established financial value. Consequently, these rights are recognized by the Shari’ah and they should not be violated. Right of Utilization (Intifa’) The right of utilization is a juridical concept that refers to a person’s temporary right over the asset of another person, who authorizes him to use it, exploit it, and dispose of its usufruct, but not the asset itself, during the period of utilization. The majority of jurists, including the Shafi’is, Malikis and Hanbalis, distinguish between the ownership of usufruct (Manfa’ah) and ownership of utilization (Intifa’). Granting ownership of utilization (Intifa’) only allows a person to directly utilise [the asset]. Granting ownership of usufruct (Manfa’ah) is more general and comprehensive; it allows its owner to use the asset himself or to enable others to use it, either for compensation, as in a lease, or without compensation, as in gratuitous lending of the asset. Right of Exclusive Lease (Hikar) Hikar is the right to lease the land of an endowment for a long period of time. The Mustahkir (exclusive lessee) makes an advance payment to the endowment which is nearly equal to the price of the land that is used to develop it or for the maintenance of its premises. Another, insignificant, amount is arranged to be paid annually to the endowment by the Mustahkir (exclusive lessee) or by whosoever this right has been transferred to. Right of Priority in Subscribing to an Increase in a Company’s Capital It is the stipulation that the existing shareholders will have the right of priority in subscribing to an increase in the company’s capital by purchasing shares at their nominal value Vacating Houses or Shops It refers to the right to stay in a house or shop. Business License It is a right granted by the authorities to some traders to deal in specific activities. Right of Demarcation It means taking possession of a piece of land and marking it with markers or a wall. Demarcation confers privilege and precedence over others. It means that whosoever demarks land is more entitled to develop it; however, it does not confer ownership. Disposal Disposal is the competence approved by the Shari’ah , or custom, or law that enables the owner of rights to dispose of them. This disposal can either be by transferring his right to others for recompense; e.g., sale or barter, or without recompense; e.g., gift, will, or by relinquishment. Abusive Use of a Right It the use of a right in such a way that it is likely to cause serious extraordinary harm to another. Expiry It is the lapse of a right due to the passage of time. However, in the Shari’h, rights do not lapse due to the mere passage of time.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard ■ The basis for prohibiting a person overwhelmed by debts from disposals that harm the creditors is the Hadith, “Allah will pay (the debts of) a person who takes the wealth of others with the intention of repaying it. But the one who takes it with the intention of destroying it, Allah will destroy him” him”. ■ The basis for the obligatory ruling of insolvency and interdiction against the one who has more debts than he can pay is the act of the Prophet (peace be upon him), who interdicted Mu’adh Ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) and sold his property for the debts against him and distributed it among his creditors.(2) This is the stance of the majority, who include Abu Yusuf and Muhammad. This is also the formal legal opinion of the Hanafis as against Abu Hanifah. ■ The multiplicity of three stages is the Maliki opinion, and this is what the (modern) legal codes also uphold. In insolvency, it is essential to consult these rules and the ruling of the court. ■ The basis for the requirement that the insolvency should be demanded by the owners of due debts is that there is no demand (warranted) for undue debt. Even if such a demand is made of the debtor, he does not have to pay it because the deferred period has a share in the price. ■ The basis for the right of a debtor to request a declaration of his own insolvency is the Shafi’i opinion and the fact that it is in his interest to stabilize his financial situation. The Standard excludes fraudulent insolvency according to the satisfaction of the court. ■ The basis for the requirement of a judicial ruling for insolvency is the act of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the case of Mu’adh. Also, insolvency needs consideration and Ijtihad; therefore, a judicial decision is required for it. ■ The basis for non-enforcement of an insolvent’s confession regarding the right of others to his property -except with the approval of the creditorsand the non-enforcement of his dispositions that transfer ownership is that they prevent harm to the creditors, as per the Hadith: “No harm and no reciprocal harm”. ■ The basis for the attachment of new dispositions to the liability of the insolvent is that the right of the creditor is attached to the property existing at the time of insolvency. Thus there is no harm in the attachment of new dispositions to the liability of the debtor because his liability is fit for such a commitment. ■ The basis for the view that gives the creditor the right to reclamation -a view accepted by the Malikis, Shafi’is, Hanbalis and some of the earliest scholars (the Salaf) as well as the majority of (modern legal) systems- is the Hadith related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim(3) that affirms the right to recourse for the seller when he finds the exact commodity with the insolvent buyer. He has the option to take it or to leave it and become a partner of the creditors in the distribution of the price. It is subject to the following conditions: a) The insolvent should be alive at the time of recourse. In the case of an institution or company, it should remain existent. b) The insolvent remains liable for all of the compensation due. If the seller has received part of it, he will be given an option regarding the remainder. c) The whole asset should remain in the ownership of the insolvent. If all or part of it has been destroyed, or if it has left his ownership through sale, or gift, or endowment, the right to reclamation will be cancelled regarding the remaining part except when the transaction involves multiple parties. d) The asset should not be in a condition where it is mingled with something from which it cannot be distinguished, nor can its characteristics have changed to the point that the original name for it no longer applies or that its value has been reduced. e) The right of another person should not relate to it, e.g., when the insolvent has pledged it as security, except when the owner of the right (the mortgagee) renounces his right to the mortgage. The right to reclamation is the cancellation of the sale. It can take place verbally or by a substitute means. It takes place immediately and does not need the decision of a judge, or the knowledge of the competent authority, or the ability to deliver. Besides that, if the asset or its value or its feature decreased, or an inseparable increase occurred in it, like an increase in the weight of livestock, and he chose reclamation, he will only have that. But if the increase is separate, it would belong to the insolvent. The right to reclaim land is not precluded by any building built on it by the insolvent nor by any trees he planted on it. The creditor will be given an option between having the insolvent remove the building and the trees, with the creditor bearing liability for any damage (to what is moved), or taking the building and trees and paying their price. In case of cultivated land, the crop will remain until harvest, free of any charge. ■ The basis for the other view, which does not recognize the right to reclamation, is that the Hadith related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim contravenes the implication of a Shari’ah principle; i.e., the liability of the insolvent remains operative and the creditor’s right regarding that liability remains stable. This group cited the Hadith: “Anyone who died or went insolvent, and some of his creditors found exactly their property, they are on a par with the other creditors”. Mursal Hadiths are valid evidence according to those who take this view. They are Hanafis and some of the Salaf.(5) ■ The basis for non-inclusion of all types of deposits of safekeeping in the insolvency assets is that they are not the property of the insolvent; interdiction only occurs regarding his property, not the property of others entrusted to him. ■ The basis for the requirement of a court ruling to rescind the interdiction of an insolvent is that it demands due consideration and Ijtihad, just as with a declaration of insolvency.",

Actual Tandid means converting commodities into cash by selling them. Tandid by estimation means evaluating commodities in order to arrive at the expected monetary value that can be realized from them. ■ The basis that profit distribution depends on the availability of liquidity is that there cannot be any profit except after the protection of the capital, and this protection is realized by liquidating the assets. ■ The basis for the prohibition of procuring liquidity through interest-based loans is the prohibition of any type of Riba (usury). The supervisory bodies are the entities most responsible for overseeing that the institutions’ liquidity is compliant with Shari’ah. This is because it is these bodies that have licensed the institutions to operate by Shari’ah-compliant procedures and prohibited them from that which violates the Shari’ah. ■ The basis for the Shari’ah-compliant methods of obtaining liquidity is provided in the Shari’ah standard for each method. ■ The basis for the Shari’ah-compliant methods of deploying liquidity is provided in the Shari’ah standard for each method.",

    "section_title": "Appendix (B)",
    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard ■ The basis for capital protection being a desirable objective is the Divine Command to adopt ways and means to protect wealth like having witnesses and documentation of the financial contracts and securing debt with mortgages and the like. Protection of wealth is one of the essential objectives that the Shari’ah has taken care of. ■ The basis for the obligation of the manager to take due diligence to protect the investment is that his role regarding the investment is that of a fiduciary. This means that he should manage the investment in a way that serves the interest of the capital provider in his capacity of his fiduciary representative. He should thus use prudent means consistent with accepted standard practice to increase the funds. ■ The basis for using permissible means to protect the investment is that all (financial) contracts are permissible by default unless proved otherwise. Furthermore, these instruments achieve the intent of the Shari’ah to safeguard wealth. ■ The basis for the investment manager not being liable for the loss of the capital, except in cases of his wilful misconduct and negligence is the consensus of Muslim jurists.(2) That is because he takes the capital with the owner’s permission and deals with it in the interest of the capital provider. He is thus the capital provider’s representative in terms of possessing and managing the capital. This means that the loss or destruction of the capital in his possession is just like its loss or destruction while in the possession of its owner because he took it with his permission. Moreover, no person, including the manager is liable to anything without a specific command by Shari’ah. ■ The basis for the impermissibility to stipulate an absolute guarantee to be provided by the manager, is that this condition strips partnership (Mudarabah and Musharakah) and agency contracts of their essential content, and turns them into a guaranteed loan contract. Moreover, these contracts are based upon trusteeship, and this condition violates their nature and implications; hence, it is void. Ibn Qudamah said, “The third type (i.e., of invalid conditions) is to stipulate what is not in the interest of the contract nor consistent with its nature and implications; e.g., stipulating that the partner is liable for the capital or for a share of the loss.” There is no disagreement among the jurists that this condition is void. ■ The basis for the opportunity cost not being compensated in the events of wilful misconduct or negligence is that it is non-existent wealth which has not been realised yet. However, realized profit after actual or constructive liquidation is treated like capital. Shari’ah-Compliant Means for Protecting Capital ■ The basis for stipulating equality among the partners in bearing loss is that partnership is based on equality between the partners. Stipulating that some partners should bear the loss more than others should violates the nature and implications of a partnership contract. Bearing the portion of loss that is supposed to be borne by another partner causes the latter partner to gain profit from that for which he has assumed no liability. The jurists agree that loss sharing in the partnership contract should be proportional to capital (contribution). ■ The basis for the permissibility to protect the capital with Takaful against any type of investment risks is that Takaful is an undertaking to make donations between the participants. It is not a contract to exchange counter-values (Mu’awadah). Its purpose is to achieve cooperation and solidarity among the participants. Hence, the Shari’ah prohibitions that apply to (conventional) commercial insurance do not apply to it. ■ The basis for the permissibility of a third party’s undertaking to bear the loss without the right of recourse to the manager is that, according to the Shari’ah, this is an undertaking to make a voluntary donation. Therefore, it is permissible by the Shari’ah provided that the third party is independent from the manager so that his undertaking does not result in the manager becoming the guarantor. ■ The basis for permissibility of deducting reserve amounts (from the profits) is that it is done with the consent of the relevant parties and is in the investors’ interest as it strengthens the investment’s financial situation. No deduction should be made from the manager’s share because the liability for loss is borne by the capital providers, not by the manager. ■ The basis for the permissibility of diversifying investment assets is that diversification achieves the interest of the investors. It does not fall under the prohibition of combining contracts in one contract because each contract is conducted independently of the other, whereby the manager divides the capital into parts and each part is invested independently in one type of contract or investment asset that differs from what the other portion of the capital is invested in. This is for the purpose of mitigating risks and diversifying returns. The parameters for each of these contracts may be sought by referring to the relevant Shari’ah Standard. ■ The basis for the permissibility of obtaining securities and guarantees for deferred payment contracts is the Quranic Verse: {“And if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then (you may resort to holding something as) mortgage, taken into possession”}, possession”} (6) and {“…who produces it is (the reward of) a camel load; I guarantee it”} it”}.(7) ■ The basis for the liability of the manager to bear the loss if he violates the Shari’ah-compliant conditions stipulated by the capital provider is the Quranic Verse: {“O you who believe! Fulfil (your) obligations”}. obligations”} (8) ■ Fulfilling contractual obligations requires the fulfilment of the conditions stipulated in them. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Muslims are bound by their conditions (stipulated in contracts and undertakings)” undertakings)”. Breaching these conditions amounts to negligence from the manager. Hence, it is compulsory upon him to bear any loss arising from this breach. Shari’ah Non-Compliant Means for Protecting Capital ■ The basis for the prohibition of a third party’s undertaking to bear the loss with the right of recourse to the manager is that this condition results in making the manager liable for the loss, which is prohibited by the Shari’ah. ■ The basis for prohibiting the manager from undertaking to buy the investment assets at their face value or at a value initially agreed upon is that this condition results in the manager undertaking to bear the partial or complete loss of the assets’ value, which is a forbidden condition as aforementioned. ■ The basis for the prohibition of a third party’s guarantee for a fee received in exchange for the guarantee is that it firstly entails excessive ambiguity because the extent of the loss is unknown at the inception of the contract, and because giving a guarantee in exchange for a fee, is prohibited by the Shari’ah. ■ See Shari’ah Standard No. (20) on Sale of Commodities in Organized Markets for the basis of the prohibition of trading in options, futures and swaps.(10)",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard ■ The basis for the differentiating between investment agency and agency in general is that the former is in order to increase wealth, and it is similar to Mudarabah and Musharakah in this respect. However, the difference between investment agency and Mudarabah and Musharakah is that Investment Agency is a form of Ijarah (hiring), while Mudarabah and Musharakah are forms of partnership. As for the general agency, it is an authorization to perform specific tasks such as payment etc. Even if the authorization is to engage in a sale/purchase, such as the authorization of the client in a Murabahah contract, its main purpose is to acquire ownership for the institution rather than investment on its behalf. ■ The basis for the permissibility of investment agency is the Hadith stating: “Engage in trade with the wealth of orphans so that it will not be consumed by Zakah”(3) as well as numerous Verses of the Qur`an on seeking sustenance, striving and earning. ■ The basis for the binding nature of the investment agency is that it is entered into for a specific period; i.e., there is an agreement between the counterparties that neither of them can unilaterally dissolve the contract except in certain circumstances specified in the contract. ■ The basis for allocating for the investment agent any profit amount in excess of the expected profit is that it is a type of conditional gift and is an incentive. ■ If the agency contract stipulates a certain percentage of profit and the agent invests in lower-yielding transactions, the agent is liable to compensate the principal for the difference between the profit earned and the average profit prevalent in the market (if it is less than the stipulated amount/percentage), because he is in breach of the conditions of the Agency. However, the agent is not liable for the specified percentage stipulated in the contract if it is higher than the prevalent market rate, because it will be tantamount to acquiring another’s wealth by illegitimate means. ■ The basis for the permissibility of employing the agency’s funds in the Mudarabah portfolio is that the authorization granted by the investment agency includes such employment when the agency is unrestricted. ■ The basis for the principle that the agent, in a situation where the agency’s funds are employed in a Mudarabah portfolio, is entitled to the agency commission and not to Mudarabah profit is that his contract with the institution is that of agency and not of Mudarabah. Even if the agent has employed the funds in a Mudarabah portfolio, the profit entitled to the institution is generated from the Mudarabah portfolio and not on the basis of agency.",

That is because, without the verbal deception, the buyer would not have proceeded with the purchase. The same basis applies for deceptive conduct being a ground for revocation. ■ The basis for the permissibility of revoking contracts on the grounds of price gouging with a trusting buyer is the Hadith stating: “Overcharging a trusting buyer (Mustarsil) is forbidden”.(2) A variant narration states: “Overcharging a trusting buyer is Riba (usury)”.(3) ■ The basis for the lapsing of the option to revoke due to the disposal of the sale item by the buyer after having discovered the deception, verbally or by conduct, is that this disposal is equivalent to an explicit consent to waive this option.",

    "section_title": "Appendix (B)",
    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Permissibility of Musaqat and Its Rationale ■ The basis for the permissibility of Musaqat is the Sunnah, Ijma’ and common sense. From the Sunnah, there is the Hadith narrated by Ibn Umar that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) gave the land of Khaybar to its inhabitants to work on and cultivate in return for half of its yield (fruits and plants).(2) Based on Ijma’, the companions (may Allah be pleased with them) practiced Musaqat in Khaybar until Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) evacuated them therefrom, without any objection from whosoever. Ijma’ or consensus (by Four Schools of Fiqh) as to permissibility of Musaqat was cited by prominent scholars Al-Bisyawi, Ibn Hazm and Al’Utabi, Muwaffaq Al-Din Ibn Qudamah, Shams Al-Din Ibn Qudamah and Al-Shamakhi, the author of “Ghayat Al-Bayan” Al-Bayan”,, Ibn Muflih and Al-Buhuti. On the basis of common sense, Musaqat fulfils the interest of both parties, and is associated with no harm. Its permissibility may also be deduced in analogy with Mudarabah. ■ The basis for bindingness of Musaqat once it has been entered into or undertaken is the overarching Quranic Verse: {“O you who believe! Fulfil (your) obligations”}. Elements of Musaqat Contract ■ The basis for stipulating legal competency in a Musaqat contract is the Prophet’s Hadith: “The Pen has been lifted from writing the deeds of three: The one who is asleep until one wakes up, the child until he/she becomes pubescent and the insane until he/she becomes sane” sane”.(5) ■ The basis for the necessity for identification of trees (subject matter of the contract), and the stipulation of the trees being arable (productive) in usual circumstances is avoidance of Gharar. Trees that are not arable (productive) do not fit the purpose of Musaqat. ■ The basis for the stipulation of irrigation and cultivation of trees is that work is one of the requisite elements of the contract (Arkan), and Musaqat is invalid in the absence of one of its requisite elements. Prerequisites of Validity ■ The basis for specification of a predetermined, common share for both parties to the contract is the Hadith narrated by Ibn Omar that the Prophet (peace be upon him) gave the land of Khaybar to its inhabitants to work on and cultivate in return for half of its yield (fruits and plants). The specification of lump-sum compensation will divert the contract away from the features of Musaqat. The determination of a known compensation is meant to avert impermissible obscurity (Jahalah). ■ The basis for the confinement of work to fruit growing and tree cultivation is that this what entails work in Musaqat; if another form of work is stipulated in the contract, such a stipulation shall contradict the very nature of the contract, as it only fulfils the interests of one party at the expense of the other. ■ The basis for making the term of Musaqat equal to the period ending with the time the produce materializes or over a term enough for the produce to materialize is the rules of justice in Shari’ah so that the trees owner does not exclusively benefit from the produce while the worker receives nothing. The produce is what the contract is meant to achieve after all, and therefore it is impermissible that the worker is devoid of his/her rights by shortening the term of Musaqat. Obligations of the Worker (Irrigator) ■ The basis for the worker’s obligation to undertake normal care of the trees and for the produce of fruits is that the people of Khaybar were entrusted with the work, without anyone else being sent by the Prophet (peace be upon him) to take up some of Musaqat works. ■ The basis for the prohibition of sub-contracting in Musaqat without prior permission is that the trees are not the property of the worker (irrigator), nor the worker is authorized by the owner of trees to do so. And notwithstanding, the owner may not accept that the worker (irrigator) assigns the Musaqat contract to a third-party irrigator. ■ The basis for the permissibility of using the services of hired hands or the like by the worker (irrigator) is the general condition cited by the Prophet (peace be upon him) to the people of Khaybar that “they may seek the services of hired hands, but only at their own expense”. However, the worker’s responsibility/liability shall not cease to exist.(6) ■ The basis for the Musaqat worker acting in a fiduciary capacity (rather than a position of liability) is that he/she is an agent on behalf of the owner in preservation and care of trees and fruits. Obligations of Trees Owner ■ The basis for the necessity to enable unfettered disposal of the trees for the worker is to allow the worker to perform his duties as per the contract. Joint Obligations of the Worker and the Owner of Trees ■ The basis for the joint responsibility of the owner of trees and the worker for the preservation of fruits before harvesting is that the owner may take the fruits after harvesting, However, before harvesting, the worker alone shall be responsible for the trees and fruits because the owner has granted him unfettered access to the trees. ■ The basis for the division of expenses between the owner and the worker (from their respective shares) is that it is more just (closer to justice) so that no harm is inflicted upon either party because of the other. ■ The basis for obligating the worker to complete the work is that Musaqat is a contract that becomes binding upon commencement of work, so that neither party shall have the right to revoke it unilaterally. And the basis for the non-entitlement of the worker to any compensation in case he stopped the work before materialization of the produce is that he abandoned his obligation toward completion of work and is thus not entitled to receive a share of the produce before materialization. And if the produce materializes, then another hand may be hired to complete the work at the expense of the worker because in such a case the worker (Al-Musaqi) is entitled to receive a share and shall not be deprived of it, and he shall complete the work, and such an obligation shall not be considered fulfilled unless work is completely carried out. Otherwise, the wage of the hired hands shall be deducted from the share of the worker (Al-Musaqi). ■ The basis for obligating the owner of trees, in case he prevented the worker from carrying out the work of Musaqat, to completely fulfil the contract is that the Musaqat contract becomes binding upon commencement of work or upon commitment of non-revocation (of the contract). And in the event that the owner revokes the contract before the produce materializes, the basis for obligating the owner to pay out the prevailing market wages is that the time and effort of the worker shall have to be compensated. And in the event that the owner revokes the contract after the produce materializes, then the worker is only entitled to his share in the produce (but not the prevailing market wages). Division of the Produce ■ The basis for the inclusivity of division of recurring produce is that the worker contributes with his work to the produce and thus shall not be deprived of his respective share. This roughly conforms to the standpoint of Ibadis and Malkis jurists, and coincides with the opinion of some of Hanifis. It has reported that Abu Said Al-Khudri opined that the worker deserves a share in the palm racemes and cotton straws, unless there is a customary practice (’Urf) or a condition (Shart) to the contrary. Abu Amr Al-Qurtubi also said: “Torn palm leaves and fibers and cords shall be shared by both parties according to their respective shares in the fruits”, and this conforms to the law of equity. ■ The basis for specification of the worker’s share as a common share is the Hadith narrated by Rafi’ on the authority of Hanzhalah Ibn Qays Al-Ansari who said: “I asked Rafi’ Ibn Khadij about paying the rental of a land in gold and silver. He answered: ‘There is no objection to it, as people in the times of the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to pay rental for plants growing on water ravines/flumes/gullies and high points of streams and some sorts of plants. However, the Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibited such practices because the produce was not properly identified: Some of it used to grow and some used to perish, and people, at that time, were confined to this kind of rentals”. ■ The basis for the entitlement of the worker to his respective share upon materialization of the produce is that he has contributed to the materialization. It is the opinion of some of Shafis and the majority of Hanbalis, and it is also followed by Imamis.(9) Contingencies in Musaqat ■ The basis for non-entitlement of the worker to anything (reward or compensation) if the produce perished or destroyed by a natural disaster is that one of the effects of partnership entails that the subject-matter of division is the produce. Therefore, if the produce perished or destroyed, then there shall be no division. The same applies to the division of remaining produce in case of partial destruction due to a natural disaster. ■ The basis for granting the worker the option, in case of non-materialization of the produce during the predetermined period of time, either to carry on his work gratis, or to stop working and lose his share in the produce, is as dictated by the rules of equity . The owner of trees benefits through keeping his trees, even if there is no produce. Any worker with an acceptable excuse is an exception, where he shall be entitled to his share for the worked period of time, as dictated by the rules of equity. Trees Belonging to Third Parties and Usurped Trees ■ The basis for the owner of trees being entitled to the fruits if it transpires that the trees belong to a third party is that in essence ownership of fruits shall remain in the hands of the owner unless by virtue of a contract. However, the contract, in this case, is void. The basis for obligating the party who contracted with the worker to pay out the prevailing wage to the maximum of his stated share is that he worked on a commutative basis, and the contract was doubtful (not properly evidenced or documented); it is impractical to pay him the agreed compensation due to the ownership of the third party, who shall be entitled to the compensation; i.e., the prevailing wage, up to a maximum of his stated share because the contracting party did not commit to pay him more than his share, especially that no transgression was premeditated. ■ The basis for entitlement of the owner of trees to take the fruits in case an usurper (Ghasib) of the trees contracted with someone else to carry out Musaqat works is that the fruits remain, in essence, owned by the owner unless by a contract to the contrary. And the contract here is void. The basis for obligating the usurper (Ghasib) to pay the worker who was unaware of usurpation is that it is tantamount to a paid work (work on a commutative basis) associated with a doubtful contract; it is impossible to pay him the agreed compensation because it belongs to someone else, who shall be entitled to the compensation; i.e., the prevailing wage. The worker shall be deprived of any payment if he is aware of usurpation because in such a case he becomes a transgressor, and he is among those referred to in the Hadith: “Ill-gotten sapling shall have no right therein” Termination of Musaqat Contract ■ The basis for termination of Musaqat contract upon completion of produce and division of the crop or passing of the agreed period of time or of a season without any fruit is the application of the contract that entered into by the two parties. ■ The basis for termination of Musaqat contract upon the death of the worker or liquidation of the institution carrying out the work if Musaqat was subject to the condition of work commencement solely by him or the institution is that the condition was not met. The basis for granting the heirs (either through inheritance, in general, or by transfer of ownership, in particular) the option either to carry on the work as per the set conditions or to stop it is that the heirs or the owners of the institution have had legally inherited this right. The basis for their entitlement to the prevailing wage is that their testator was entitled to the compensation by virtue of his efforts. So if he had died before the produce materialized, then he shall be entitled to the compensation. The basis for limiting the compensation, which is the prevailing wage, to a maximum of the testator’s share in the produce is that the owner of trees did not commit to pay more than the worker’s share. And if continuation of work by the heirs does not entitle them to more than the share of their testator in the produce, then how shall they deserve more without work? ■ The basis for termination of Musaqat contract upon perishing of trees, subject matter of the contract, or inability of the trees to bear fruit is the Hadith stating: “There should be neither harm nor malice” malice”, because the worker will be excessively harmed if he is obligated to work gratis (without compensation). Revocation of Musaqat Contract ■ The basis for revocation of Musaqat contract by mutual consent of the two parties is the Hadith of Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him) stating: “Anyone who consents to revoke the contract upon the request of a regretting counterparty, Allah shall forgive his regretful sins on the Day of Judgment”. ■ The basis for obligation to pay the prevailing wage if the worker is unable to perform the work due to a reason out of his control is that the worker did exert an effort under a contract, therefore he shall be entitled to a compensation against that work, and that the work has not been performed in its entirety, and thus he is paid the prevailing market wage. ■ The basis for liability of the worker to indemnify the owner for actual loss suffered for a reason within his control is that he caused such a loss, and therefore shall be liable.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Option to Reconsider Due to Defect ■ The basis for permissibility of the option to reconsider due to defect is the Hadith narrated by ’A`ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that a man purchased a young serf, and then set him to work, then he found him to be “flawed” or “defective”, so he returned him back (to the seller) on the grounds of the defect. Thereupon, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “No yield without risk taking” and in another narration: “No gain without risk taking”.(2) Also, there is the Hadith on a sheep whose udder is tied up in order to look like a one full with milk. If the defect, lack of milk, is unveiled, then the buyer shall have the option either to keep it or to return it along with a Sa’ of dates. All Schools of Fiqh (Madhahib) embraced this option, and that the key principle in the contracts of sale is freedom from defects. ■ The basis for the stipulation of freedom from defects is what the companions (may Allah be pleased with them all) used to practice, and Othman (may Allah be pleased with him) issued a rule in favor of using this option in presence of the companions.(3) ■ The basis for the effect of the option either to return the subject matter or keep the entire price –which is the standpoint of Hanafis and Shafis- is that the buyer has the right to return the subject-matter due to defect and the absence of intactness as generally dictated by the contract. The basis for non-entitlement to compensation (Arsh) in the case where the buyer keeps the subject-matter is that descriptions (features) are not considered to form part of the price in this case, and because the buyer did not consent that the sold item was transferred for a less than its stated price. The Hanbalis were of the opinions that in case of return, the buyer shall have the right to request Arsh, corresponding to the inferiority caused by the defect. Option of Deal Fragmentation ■ The basis for permissibility of deal fragmentation is that it is a type of defect (some Fiqh references categorized it under the option to reconsider due to defect) and it becomes binding upon returning of a part of the object of sale.(4) ■ The basis for the stipulation that the buyer shall not harbor prior knowledge about the deal coming into a point of defragmentation is that his knowledge is viewed as evidence to consent, and that the defect is not hidden or concealed. ■ The basis for the effect of the option of defragmentation being either termination or holding into the remainder of his share in the price is that discounting an amount from the price for the whole deal in lieu of the missing part of the deal represents compensation, and no more than it, because the price (compensation) is for the two parts and is divided between them both. Option of Breach of Description ■ The permissibility of this option is the opinion of the majority of Fuqaha, while other Fuqaha categorized this option under option of deception (Khiyar al-Tadlis). ■ The basis for the establishment of compensation due to incorrect description is that it is practically similar to the option of freedom from defect, in the case of objection to return the object of sale. And in the case where the buyer accepts to keep the object of sale, then he will possess it for the entire price -without application of Arsh- because what is missing here is a description, and descriptions do not have their corresponding part of the price in this instance. ■ The basis for transferability of this option upon death to heirs, whether general or special, is that it falls in the category of physical asset (’Ayn) ownership.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Cooling-Off Option ■ The basis for cooling-off option is the Hadith narrated by Habban Bin Munqidh, attributed to the Prophet (peace be upon him), saying: “If you are concluding a deal say: ‘There shall be no Khalabah (misleading marketing or showcasing of products), then you shall have a 3-day option’”. ■ The basis for consideration of all expressions that imply the cooling-off option is the opinion of the Four Schools of Fiqh (Madhahib).(3) Imam AlNawawi said: “This expression (as mentioned in the Hadith related by Ibn Hibban: “There shall be no Khalabah...” is neither considered to be a kind of literal worship, nor a Shari’ah ruling that a religiously accountable person shall be aware of it”.(4) ■ The basis for the stipulation of timing for cooling-off conditions is that an untimed option results in Jahalah (obscurity or ambiguity) which may lead to dispute. This is the opinion of the majority of Fuqaha. ■ The basis for the stipulation of attaching the option to the contract is that detachment contradicts the prerequisites of the contract, which entails that it takes effect immediately.(5) ■ The basis for the stipulation of attaching the option to a binding contract is that its usability comes into existence only when attached to such a contract. The basis for invalidity of the stipulation of such an option in contracts that entail taking possession (Qabd) is that it contravenes Qabd stipulated in Sarf and in Salam. ■ The basis for permissibility (but not the obligability) of delivery of the two countervalues is that delivery serves both selection and reconsideration, which are literally the purpose of the option. ■ The basis for the situation where the option does not abate upon offering it for sale is that such a practice is meant to probe the fairness of the price. However, it does abate in case of actual sale because this serves as a testimony to acceptance, as the disposal of the object underlying the option is considered to be as the disposal by owners. ■ The basis for effecting ownership upon sale is that the price does not change if the two parties opted for continuity of ownership, and this conforms to the Hanafi School, as opposed to Hanbalis. If the option is rested with one party, then the position of this standard is based on a variety of perspectives. [see applications in the Shari’ah Standard No. (8) on Murabahah] Option to Revoke Due to Non-Payment ■ The basis for permissibility is Qiyas (analogical deduction) to the cooling-off option and reports dating back to the time of the companions. It was taken up by Hanafis, Malikis and Hanbalis. The wisdom behind its permissibility is the need for the buyer to reconsider/re-evaluate his knowledge about prices and for the seller to ensure that the proper price is quoted in order to avoid procrastination by the buyer. ■ The basis for impermissibility in contracts in which taking possession (Qabd) is a stipulation –such as Sarf and Salam- is that it is inconsistent with the stipulations of their validity. ■ The basis for abating of the option upon the death of its owner is that it constitutes a readiness and willingness to act, and therefore is not transferable to heirs. Either-Or Option ■ The basis for permissibility of the either-or option is Qiyas (analogical deduction) to the cooling-off option; since it conforms to Shari’ah injunctions- i.e., the cooling-off option- so it was permissible based on it, and due to the need of the buyer to employ it in case of hesitancy as to selection of the most needful from amongst a number of objects. The majority of Fuqaha adopted it though with different views on definition and scope. ■ The basis for all issues pertaining to ownership is the application of the rules relating to Daman (liability) and destruction (of objects of sales) and to treat both parties according to rules of equity in relation to the price that needs to be paid if the subject-matter of the option is destroyed. ■ The basis for the transferability of the option to heirs is that a testator has an established ownership in the objects subject matter of the option, and as such heirs shall need to identify their selection. ■ The basis for impermissibility of sale and tradability of either-or options is that such options are construed to be mere readiness and willingness (to contract), which cannot be transferred or traded. ■ The basis for combination of two options or more is that such combination does not contradict their prerequisites -i.e., the effectuating of sale on an immediate basis.",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard ■ The basis for permissibility of ’Arboun (Earnest Money) is a narration that Nafi’ Ibn Abdul-Harith purchased a building in Mecca to be used as a prison from Safwan Ibn Umayyah, provided that if Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) approves the sale, then the sale is considered to be effected by him (Umar) and on his behalf (Umar’s), and if not, then Safwan shall be paid 400 dinars. Also, there is a narration that Ibn Sirin said: “A man said to a lessor of ride camels: prepare your camels, so that if I did not leave with you on so and so day, you get 100 dirhams. Then he did not leave with him”. And Shurayh said: “He who voluntarily makes it incumbent upon himself to do something (with a condition and without coercion), then he shall have to honor the condition”. Hence, ’Arboun is similar, where a buyer pays part of the price and says: “If I did not confirm the sale, the ’Arboun is yours to keep”. Payment of the ’Arboun either at time of contract or later at the time of relinquishing it is valid. ■ The basis for impermissibly of ’Arboun in Sarf and Salam contracts is that ’Arboun is embedded with a cooling-off option (Khiyar al-Shart), which according to the majority of Fuqaha (of the Four Schools of Fiqh) is impermissible in Sarf contracts (currency exchange transactions). This rule was deduced from the Hadith: “Gold for gold, silver for silver... like for like, equal for equal, and hand to hand. If these types differ, then sell them as you find proper, provided it is hand to hand”. Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with both of them) is reported to have said: “O, Messenger of Allah, hold on that I may ask you a question: I sell camels in Baqi’, so that I sell for dinars and receive dirhams, and I sell for dirhams and receive dinars. I take so and so of this and pay so and so of that? Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “No harm that you apply the market rate unless you (you and the counterparty) leave the transaction session without settlement of dues”. Therefore, this was an evidence on the requirement to take possession of both countervalues (Qabd) at the contracting session (Majlis al-’Aqd). ’Arboun is also impermissible in Salam contract, because in Salam, payment of the price (capital of Salam) shall be settled at the contracting session. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Whoever pays money in advance for dates (to be delivered later) should pay it for a known specified weight and measure (of the dates)….”. This implies that unless the price is paid in full before the two parties leave the contracting session, the transaction is not deemed to be Salaf (or Salam). ■ The basis for determination of a specific term for ’Arboun is to avoid Gharar that may result from an unknown term (Jahalah that involves ’Arboun term). ■ The basis for the seller being liable for the object of sale before delivery and for the buyer being liable for it after delivery is the Shari’ah maxim: “Ownership (title) shall be established upon the conclusion of the contract, while liability is contingent upon delivery (Qabd)”. ■ The basis for attributing growth connected to the original is that it represents an integral part of it. ■ The basis for attributing growth and yields, separate from the object of sale, to the object of sale is the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “Al-Kharaj Bi al-Daman” (i.e., entitlement to revenue is based on bearing liability for the revenue-generating asset).",

    "chunk_text": "Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard ■ Stipulation of cooling-off options apply only to binding contracts because nonbinding contracts are by their nature revocable by one or both parties. ■ The validity of revocation by any form of language, that indicates it, is based on the general Shari’ah maxim: “Contracts are interpreted according to intent and inherent meaning of the parties and not by the words or forms used” (Maxims of Al-Majallah Al-’Adliyyah) and the statement of some jurists that the use of the technical word “Revocation” is designated by jurists and what is important is its meaning. ■ The existence of the cause triggering the option to revoke is required because revocation is contrary to the norm and rule that contracts are generally binding and that in principle consequences must flow necessarily from their causes, and that the cause must exist at the time of revocation. ■ The requirement that the other party be notified of revocation is based on the opinion of Abu Hanifah and Muhammad Ibn Al-Hasan, contrary to the opinion of the majority of jurists, because notification averts harm from the other party who, unaware of the revocation, may conduct themselves to their detriment. ■ The four impediments to the exercise of cooling-off options are based variously on the following rationale: (I) Revocation would contradict the basic elements of the contract which have been validly established; or (II) revocation would contradict consent implied by conduct (implied terms have the same legal effect as express ones); or (III) revocation is impossible because the term of the contract has expired; or (IV) the subject matter of the option to revoke is deemed by law to have ceased to exist. ■ The basis for the ruling on the effect of revocation and that revocation nullifies the contract immediately, is the prevailing viewpoint of the Shafi’i and Hanbali schools. Revocation invalidates ownership in sale contracts. This ruling holds true for the asset sold (subject-matter of the contract), whereas increments in the asset sold (separate growth) from time of contracting until revocation and before delivery to buyer, belong to the seller who becomes the owner at or just prior to time of revocation. When the buyer takes possession of the asset sold, any separate growth belongs to him. ■ The basis for the rulings stated in item 9 regarding waiver of revocation right is the viewpoint which Al-Zarkashi has indicated in his book titled “Al-Manthur Fi Al-Qawa’id”. ■ The basis for impermissibility of stipulating compensation in the contract as a condition for waiver of revocation right, is based on analogy to Iqalah, which is considered as one form of contract revocation and has to be performed without any increase or decrease in considerations. Similarly, Shari’ah prohibits waiver of some rights (such as pre-emption and demarcation rights) against compensation. ■ The basis for permissibility of stipulating, in the contract, compensation for waiver of the remaining periods of revocation right, in case of continuous contracts such as leasing, is the fact that the party who waives his right owns a benefit that makes him entitled to remuneration. ■ The basis for applications of conditional revocation is the rulings indicated in the Shari’ah standard that relates to each application, because rulings on these applications are derived from these preceding standards.",
