    "chunk_text": "Introduction The Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI), formerly known as Financial Accounting Organization for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions, was established in accordance with the Agreement of Association which was signed by Islamic financial institutions on 1 Safar 1410 A.H. (26 February 1990 A.D.) in Algiers. AAOIFI was registered on 11 Ramadan 1411 A.H. (27 March 1991 A.D.) in the Kingdom of Bahrain as an international autonomous non-profit making corporate body. Objectives of AAOIFI To develop accounting and auditing thoughts relevant to Islamic financial institutions To disseminate accounting and auditing thoughts relevant to Islamic financial institutions and their applications through training, seminars, publication of periodical newsletters, carrying out and commissioning of research and other means To prepare, promulgate and interpret accounting and auditing standards for Islamic financial institutions To review and amend accounting and auditing standards for Islamic financial institutions AAOIFI carries out these objectives in accordance with the precepts of Islamic Shari’ah, which represents a comprehensive system for all aspects of life, in conformity with the environment in which Islamic financial institutions have developed. This activity is intended both to enhance the confidence of users of the financial statements of Islamic financial institutions in the information that is produced about these institutions, and to encourage these users to invest or deposit their funds in Islamic financial institutions and to use their services. Before the establishment of AAOIFI, intensive efforts were made on both administrative and technical levels, beginning with the working paper presented by the Islamic Development Bank during the annual meeting of its Board of Governors in Istanbul in March 1987. Thereafter, a number of committees were formed to examine appropriate methods of preparing accounting standards for Islamic financial institutions. These committees produced several research studies and reports.¹ Since its establishment in 1411 A.H. (1991 A.D.) until 1415 A.H. (1995 A.D.), the organizational structure of AAOIFI comprised: A Supervisory Committee (seventeen members) A Financial Accounting Standards Board (twenty-one members) An Executive Committee (appointed from within the Standards Board) A Shari’ah Committee (four members) After four years of work, the Supervisory Committee formed a Review Committee to examine AAOIFI’s statute and organizational structure. The amendments approved by the Supervisory Committee included: Renaming the Organization Changing the organizational structure to consist of: General Assembly Board of Trustees (replacing the Supervisory Committee) Accounting and Auditing Standards Board (replacing the former board focused solely on accounting standards) Executive Committee Shari’ah Board (replacing the Shari’ah Committee) General Secretariat (headed by a Secretary-General) Changing AAOIFI’s financing method: Establishing a Waqf (endowment) and charity fund financed from a one-time membership fee Supplementing the fund with annual subscription fees, grants, donations, bequests, and other sources Membership categories were also revised to include: Founding Members Non-founding Members Observing Members An updated list of AAOIFI’s members is attached to the statute. In 1419 A.H. (1998 A.D.), additional amendments broadened AAOIFI’s objectives. Article (4) of the amended statute states that AAOIFI shall: Develop the accounting, auditing and banking practices thought relating to the activities of Islamic financial institutions Disseminate the accounting and auditing thought relating to the activities of Islamic financial institutions and their applications through training, seminars, publication of periodical newsletters, preparation of research and other means Prepare, promulgate and interpret accounting and auditing standards for Islamic financial institutions in order to harmonize the accounting practices adopted by these institutions in the preparation of their financial statements, as well as to harmonize the auditing procedures adopted in auditing the financial statements prepared by Islamic financial institutions Review and amend the accounting and auditing standards for Islamic financial institutions to cope with developments in the accounting and auditing thought and practices Prepare, issue, review and adjust the statements and guidelines on the banking, investment and insurance practices of Islamic financial institutions Approach the concerned regulatory bodies, Islamic financial institutions, other financial institutions that offer Islamic financial services, and accounting and auditing firms in order to implement the accounting and auditing standards, as well as the statements and guidelines on the banking, investment and insurance practices of Islamic financial institutions that are published by AAOIFI The amendments also renamed “Non-founding Members” as Associate Members. Article (3) of the amended statute states that Associate Members shall comprise: Islamic financial institutions that comply with Islamic Shari’ah rules and principles in all their transactions Regulatory and supervisory authorities that supervise Islamic financial institutions (including central banks, monetary agencies, and other similar authorities) Islamic Fiqh academies and authorities that have a corporate entity Observing Members shall comprise: Organizations and associations responsible for regulating the accounting and auditing profession and/or preparing accounting and auditing standards Practicing certified accounting and auditing firms that have an interest in the accounting and auditing practices of Islamic financial institutions Financial institutions engaged in financial activities of Islamic institutions Users of financial statements of Islamic financial institutions (both individuals and corporate) Article (8) of the amended statute specifies that every member must pay the prescribed membership fee and the annual subscription fee, and must comply with AAOIFI’s statute and bylaws. In 1425 A.H. (2004 A.D.), further amendments included: Expanding membership categories to include Supporting Members (users of financial statements of Islamic financial institutions, both individuals and corporate, and all local and international financial institutions that already have or intend to have relations with Islamic financial institutions’ products) Granting AAOIFI the ability to offer a testing and certification program in the areas of accounting, auditing, financial analysis, and Islamic banking, conducted either by AAOIFI or in cooperation with other parties ¹ These studies and reports are compiled in five volumes and were lodged in the library of the Islamic Research and Training Institute of the Islamic Development Bank in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (serial no. 332/121021).",

When the Institution deposits to the credit of a customer’s account a sum of money directly or through a bank transfer. 2. When the customer enters into a spot contract of currency exchange between himself and the Institution, in the case of the purchase of a currency against another currency already deposited in the account of the customer. 3. When the Institution debits – by the order of the customer – a sum of money to the latter’s account and credits it to another account in a different currency, either in the same Institution or another Institution, for the benefit of the customer or any other payee. In following such a procedure, the Institution shall adhere to the principles of Islamic law regarding currency exchange. A delay in making the transfer is allowed to the Institution, consistent with the practice whereby a payee may obtain actual receipt according to prevailing business practices in currency markets. However, the payee is not entitled to dispose of the currency during the transfer period, unless and until the effect of the bank transfer has taken effect so that the payee is able to make an actual delivery of the currency to a third party. b) Receipt of a cheque constitutes constructive possession, provid ed the balance payable is available in the account of the issuer in the currency of the cheque and the Institution has blocked such a balance for payment. c) The receipt of a voucher by a merchant, signed by the credit card holder (buyer), is constructive possession of the amount of currency entered as payable on the coupon provided that the card issuing Institution pays the amount without deferment to the merchant accepting the card.",

The bank can also finance government projects using Islamic instruments. Among the possible alternatives for the purpose of set-off is for the bank to maintain current accounts that accrue no interest or disposing of the interest earned, if that is impossible, and adapting the ways of dealing with the central bank for acquiring liquidity, for example, by the opening of investment accounts for the central bank.",

    "chunk_text": "Transfer of money (remittances) The request of a customer for the Institution to transfer a certain amount of money in the same currency from his current account to a particular beneficiary is a transfer of debt if the applicant is a debtor to such a beneficiary. The fee that the Institution gains from this transaction is consideration for the delivery of the money and it is not an additional amount gained by the Institution over the amount transferred. However, if a remittance is to take place in a currency different from that presented by the applicant for the transfer, then the transaction consists of a combination of currency exchange and a transfer of money that is permissible. [see item 2/11 of the Shari’ah Standard on Trading in Currencies] Appendix (B) The Shari’ah Basis for the Standard Permissibility of Hawalah The contract of Hawalah derives its permissibility from the Qur`an, the Sunnah, Ijma’ (consensus of Fuqaha) and reasoning. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Default on payment by a solvent debtor is unjust, and if anyone of you is transferred to a solvent person, he must accept the transfer.”(2) In another text of the Hadith, related by Ahmad and Al-Bayhaqi, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “If one is referred to a solvent person for the recovery of his right, such a person must accept the transfer”. The Prophet’s order that the creditor must accept the transfer means transfer of debt is legal, otherwise he would not give that order. The permissibility of Hawalah has enjoyed unanimity in Muslim soci eties and communities from time immemorial and there is no report that anyone has disapproved of it.(3) The acceptance of a Hawalah contract is recommended for the transferee if the potential payer is known to be solvent and keeps his promises in respect to payments because it benefits the creditor and gives relief to the debtor from liability by the transfer. The basis that a Hawalah transaction is also Mubah (permissible) for the transferee if the financial status and creditworthiness of the potential payer are unknown is that the order in the above-mentioned Hadith does not make it a condition that the payer be solvent for the permissibility of Hawalah. If the payer is not solvent then the acceptance of the Hawalah by the transferee remains permissible. A Hawalah Contract is Binding If all its conditions are met, a Hawalah contract becomes binding without any difference of opinion among the scholars. Form of a Hawalah Contract The contract of Hawalah cannot be concluded on a deferred basis or subject to the happening of a particular event, as it has the character of a contract of (immediate) exchange. This is because by virtue of the Hawalah contract both the transferee (the payee) and the payer have immediately entered into a new contractual relationship. Also, a Hawalah cannot be concluded on a temporary basis nor can it be contingent on future events, because this conflicts with the nature of Hawalah which is the immediate transfer of the debt to the payer.(4) Types and Rulings of a Hawalah Contract ■ The scholars have unanimously endorsed the permissibility of restricted Hawalah, whether it is restricted to a debt owed to the transferor by the payer or it is restricted to the value of a tangible good belonging to the transferor in the possession of the payer. The unrestricted Hawalah is permitted by the Hanafis only. They based this permissibility on the Prophet’s order that a Hawalah deal must be accepted, without indicating that the payer must be a debtor to the transferor or not. This shows the permissibility of both the unrestricted and restricted Hawalah.(5) ■ The basis for the permissibility of a deferred Hawalah contract is that the payer is liable to make payment to the payee (transferee) by virtue of Hawalah. This permissibility is analogous to the permissibility of a de Hawalah. This permissibility is analogous to the permissibility of a de ferred guarantee contract. As a matter of principle, a right that is due by virtue of Hawalah is similar to a right that is due by virtue of a guarantee contract. Since the latter can be concluded on a deferred basis, so a Hawa lah transaction.(6) ■ The basis for the permissibility of Hawalat al-Haqq (transfer of a right) as advocated by the Hanafis is that its essence is similar to suretyship which is permitted by all four schools of Islamic law, regardless of the name of the contract in this regard.(7) Again, Hawalat al-Haqq does not significantly differ from restricted transfer of debt. If one looks at the change of creditor, then the transaction is one of transfer of rights, and if one looks at the change of debtor, it is a restricted transfer of debt. The differences between transfer of debt and transfer of right are evident in some forms, such as when the creditor makes a gift of the amount of his debt claim against the payer to a person who is not a debtor to the transferor. Here, there are not two debts, hence there is a transfer of right and not a restricted Hawalah because of the lack of two debtors, as the transferor here is not a creditor of the beneficiary from the gift. Conditions of Hawalah ■ The basis for the necessity of the consent of all the three parties in a Hawalah contract is as follows: a) The transferor is required to consent because he might not want a third party to pay the debt on his behalf. Therefore, his consent is necessary party to pay the debt on his behalf. Therefore, his consent is necessary for the permissibility of the Hawalah contract. b) The transferee must also consent to the Hawalah contract because the Hawalah contract necessitates a transfer of his right to payment from the transferor as debtor to another person (the payer), and people differ in various aspects when it comes to payment of debts. c) The payer must also consent in the unrestricted Hawalah because the effect of the Hawalah contract is to make the payer liable for payment and, as a principle; there is no liability without there first being an acceptance of such liability.(8) ■ The basis for the requirement that the transferred debt or the trans ferred part of a debt be equal to the payable debt in kind, type, quality or amount is to avoid Riba. However, this condition does not mean that the liability of the transferor must be similar in quantity to the liability of the payer towards the transferor in order to make a Hawalah con tract valid. In other words, a Hawalah contract is permissible even if the amount of one of the two liabilities is either greater or lesser than the other liability provided that the transferee will be paid only an amount equivalent to his debt. For example, one can transfer the right to his creditor to collect 10 dinars, the equivalent amount of his debt, out of the 20 dinars he is owed. The transferor may also direct the transferee to collect five dinars being his right against the payer out of the ten the transferor owes the transferee. Therefore, the similarity in amount that is required here is that the transferee must not take more than the actual amount of his debt. The intention of this is to avoid Riba.(9) Effect of Hawalah on the Relationship Between the Transferor and the Transferee ■ The reason for saying that the transferor is discharged from liability after the conclusion of a Hawalah transaction is because this is the legal effect of Hawalah. Hawalah means that the other party (the transferee) effect of Hawalah. Hawalah means that the other party (the transferee) is deemed to have received his right to payment by the payer outright, which connotes its obligatory nature. Therefore, the transaction can not be reversed for the simple reason that if something is transferred then it cannot be argued that it remains in the same place. This means the transferee is not entitled to ask the transferor for payment and the payer, on the other hand, becomes liable for payment.(10) ■ The right of the transferee to have recourse, in the event of non-per formance by the payer, to the transferor as advocated by the Hanafis is based on a Hadith. It is reported that Uthman Ibn Affan was asked about a situation in which a transfer of debt is concluded and the transferee found the payer had died in a state of bankruptcy. The answer was that the transferee is entitled to return to the transferor for payment, as the right of a Muslim cannot go unfulfilled.(11) This report reveals that the transferor has a right of recourse to the original debtor if the payment is not attained due to bankruptcy or death of the payer. ■ The Hadith that says, Muslims are bound by the conditions they made(12) is the basis for the view of the majority of jurists that the transferee has a right of recourse to the transferor if he had stipulated that he accepts the transfer on the basis that the payer is solvent and is capable of paying the amount of the debt. Moreover, this stipulation serves the purpose of the contract; hence, termination of the contract takes place if such a condition is not met.(13) The Effect of Hawalah on the Relationship Between the Transferor and the Payer The basis for the rule that the transferor loses his claim over the amount of the debt against the payer after the Hawalah transaction is that the right to this claim has shifted to the transferee by virtue of the contract of Hawalah. The Effect of Hawalah on the Relationship Between the Transferee and the Payer The basis for the rule that the transferee no longer has a financial claim against the transferor is that the contract of Hawalah transfers the liability to pay to the payer.(14) The right of the payer to be entitled to all rights associated with the securities that were available to the debtor (the transferor) is based on the fact that these securities are associated with the debt of the transfer or, which are the subject matter of the Hawalah contract. These rights are therefore transferable with the transfer of the debt liability. Hence, the payer is entitled to all these rights as well. Effect of Death and Bankruptcy on a Hawalah Contract The basis that the death of the transferor will not affect the Hawalah contract is that the transferor, after the Hawalah contract, is not entitled to the transferred debt.(16) In addition, the reason why the death of the payer will not affect the Hawalah contract is that the heirs or the guarantor of the payer, if any, will be liable for payment.(17) The practices of overdrafts, negotiable instruments and endorsing cheques and bills of exchange are valid because they are practical applications of the concept of Hawalah. Transfer of Money (Remittances) The International Islamic Fiqh Academy has issued a resolution in respect to the permissible solutions for the combination of transfer of money (banking remittances) and currency exchange.(18)",

Such payment may be made against a letter of guarantee from the beneficiary. ■ Import and export credit (depending on the issuing bank). ■ Local and foreign credit. ■ Confirmed and non-confirmed credits. ■ Partial shipment and a non-partial shipment credit. ■ On sight or immediate payment credit, deferred payment cred it, acceptance credit and negotiable credit. ■ Syndicated credit (partnership credit), which describes the state of participation by more than one bank due to the huge amount of credit granted with each bank providing a letter of guarantee, to the extent of its participation, to the leading bank. ■ Standby credit (guarantee credit).

Accordingly, it is not permissible for an institution to charge an amount in addition to the actual expenses incurred if it endorses a credit facility issued by another bank, because endorsing a credit facility is an addition over guarantee. The rule for endorsement applies to participation in the issuance and endorsement of credit as well as issuance of standby credit (guarantee credit), as long as services or obligations are not required. b) The issuance of a credit facility should not involve Riba bear ing profits or become a means for such profits. c) It is not permissible to use a combination of contracts in documentary credit as an excuse for involvement in the prohibited transactions, such as taking a commission for providing a guarantee or extending a loan.",

The Shari’ah classifies such contracts as a form of Ju’alah, where the State is the “Ja’il” (Ju’alah initiator), the licensee Institution is the “’Amil” (hired party) and the specific amount to be received by the latter is the “Ju’l” (compensation amount).

He shall be held responsible for indemnity only when the damage results from his own misconduct, negligence or breach of terms or stipulations of the contract. Breach of contract for this purpose does not include acts that serve the interest of the principal, like selling at a higher or buying at a lower price. In this regard, Shari’ah Standard No. (5) on Guarantees indicates under item 2/2/2 the following: “It is not permissible to combine agency and personal guarantees in one contract at the same time (i.e. the same party acting in the capacity of an agent on one hand and acting as a guarantor on the other hand), because such a combination conflicts with the nature of these contracts. In addition, a guarantee given by a party acting as an agent in respect of an investment turns the transaction into an interest-based loan, since the capital of the investment is guaranteed in addition to the proceeds of the investment, (i.e. as though the investment agent had taken a loan and repaid it with an additional sum which is tantamount to Riba). But if a guarantee is not stipulated in the agency contract and the agent voluntarily provides a guarantee to his principals independently of the agency contract, the agent becomes a guarantor in a different capacity from that of agent. In this case, such an agent will remain liable as guarantor even if he is discharged from acting as agent”.",

Another example here is the case of somebody purchasing a commodity for an amount of money in a bundle or in his pocket. A third example is purchasing the commodity by using a currency which the buyer ignores its issuer and has no indication that could help him to know it. In all these cases, Gharar nullifies the sale contract. However, there are some cases where Gharar in the price is permitted, as - for instance - when the sale contract is concluded at the market price on the day of purchase, or at the price to be set by the market on the day of purchase, or at the price people usually sell at. Sale with forgivable Gharar in price could also include purchasing commodities through Bay’ al- Istjrar, in which the buyer obtains the goods regularly from the seller for a price to be determined subject to the price that people normally sell at, or subject to an index, and even after consumption of the goods in question. A similar sale contract is that which comprises selling, at unit price, of a quantity of the commodity which the buyer can see, yet does not know its exact amount or total value. That is to say, one could sell a quantity of grains at the price per kilogram, or he could rent a car at a rent per mile, so that the payable amount of rent is determined after reaching the target destination. Furthermore, such sales may include concluding a lease contract at the rent normally paid for similar property, or for a variable rent to be indicated by a specialized index. In all these preceding cases, the contract does not become null and void.",

The first part is used in Murabahah contracts with parties that have strong credit ratings in a way that the combination of the principal amount and the profit of Murabahah protect the initial capital. The second part is used in ’Arboun contracts to purchase assets. If the value of the assets rises, the purchase contracts are completed and the assets are sold for a profit. If the value of the assets declines, the purchase contracts are not completed and the loss is limited to the amount of the ’Arboun, while the capital is protected by the Murabahah contracts. It is compulsory in this method to observe the Shari’ah rules relating to ’Arboun. This includes the requirement to reserve the assets sold under the ’Arboun contract from the time of contract conclusion until the settlement date and the impermissibility of trading in ’Arboun contracts.
